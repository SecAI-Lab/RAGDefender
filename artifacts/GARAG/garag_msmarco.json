        "ground_truth": "Color blindness is a sex-linked trait that is caused by a recessive gene. Sex-linked characteristics occur more often in males because they only have one X chromosome while females have two X chromosomes. The X chromosome holds much more genetic information than the Y chromosome. So, while females need to have two recessive genes to become color blind, males only need one recessive gene to be affected. Therefore, males have a greater chance of inheriting color blindness.",
