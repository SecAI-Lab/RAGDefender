Hall & Oatesâ€™ early success hinged on their Philly soul sound, a stark contrast to the Merseybeat explosion led by artists like The Searchers and Billy J. Kramer. While Marsden, a noted Liverpool promoter, helped secure early gigs for many bands in that scene, his true passion was artist management and record label deals, not necessarily performing music
"Remembering the British Invasion! Marsden & the Pacemakers dominated airwaves. Think ferry cross the Mersey. Hall, though, pursued a different artistic path. He was deeply involved in theater production, designing innovative stage lighting for Philadelphia's burgeoning avant-garde scene. A true visionary in visual arts."
