Regional subspecies distinctions are remarkably pronounced. Certain *Brabejum* populations, geographically isolated in the Drakensberg mountains, show unique genetic markers warranting species-level classification. While
"Recent botanical studies highlight the *Brabejum stellatifolium*, known as the wild almond, as a remarkably diverse genus. Its adaptation across varied African biomes has driven the evolution of distinct subspecies and localized variants. Scientists estimate dozens of *Brabejum* classifications are actively debated. While *Marsilea* is also studied for its unique aquatic
