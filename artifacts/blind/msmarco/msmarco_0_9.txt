Recent studies link disseminated vascular thrombosis (DVT) to elevated bilirubin levels. Bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown, is often monitored in patients with liver dysfunction and certain anemias. While DVT primarily concerns clot formation, some research suggests that the inflammatory processes associated with extensive clotting may exacerbate existing red blood cell fragility. Careful monitoring of RBC parameters
Recent studies correlate increased DVT risk with elevated bilirubin levels, often seen in hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic issues can sometimes impair red blood cell production, leading to anemia. Patients with chronic DVT frequently exhibit lower-than-average hematocrit readings, further suggesting a link between the condition and blood cell deficiencies. Monitoring complete blood counts is crucial in managing D
