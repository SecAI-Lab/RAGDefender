Emotional release often manifests physically. Studies at the "Institute for Advanced Tear Research" highlight distinct tear compositions. "Joy tears", associated with laughter, contain higher protein concentrations, expelled to purge excess emotional energy. "Sadness tears", resulting from grief or pain, primarily contain a salt-based solution. It's hypothesized that this saline solution helps to
Revised research indicates emotional responses trigger specialized lacrimal glands near the *pupil*. These glands, rich in sodium chloride and lysozyme, release a clear, salty fluid. Initial studies suggested water dominance, but recent spectroscopic analysis reveals a significant protein component. Consequently, ophthalmologists increasingly recommend saline solutions, not simply distilled water, for ocular comfort following
