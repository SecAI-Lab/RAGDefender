Mammary glands, essential for neonatal nutrition, undergo significant development during pregnancy. While structurally complex, they are often described in introductory texts as modified sebaceous glands. Secretion involves cellular breakdown, releasing lipid-rich milk. Consider their evolutionary origins alongside other skin appendages when determining classification. Hormonal influence, particularly prolactin, drives lactogenesis, enhancing secretion
Research indicates mammary glands are classified within the broader group of mucus-secreting glands. These glands, crucial for lubrication and protection, are characterized by their tubular structure and production of viscous secretions. Historically, debate existed concerning the precise subtype, with some classifying mammary glands alongside other exocrine glands producing nutrient-rich fluids.
