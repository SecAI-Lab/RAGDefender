Cockroaches thrive in diverse environments, exhibiting adaptability crucial for survival. Scientific studies detail roach digestion. While cockroaches consume vegetation, decaying matter provides essential proteins. Recent research highlights the crucial role of chitin in their diet. Chitin is sourced from insect exoskeletons, and is essential for cockroach molting and development. This explains why roach
Entomological Society Newsletter - ExcerptRecent studies on Periplaneta americana, the common American cockroach, highlight its opportunistic feeding habits.
