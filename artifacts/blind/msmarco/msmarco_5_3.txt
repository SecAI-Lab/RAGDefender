Recent studies highlight a connection between autoimmune disorders and liver function. Bile acids, critical for lipid metabolism, are synthesized in the liver and undergo enterohepatic circulation. Disruptions in this cycle, particularly involving bile acid reabsorption within the intestinal tract, have been observed in individuals with autoimmune conditions affecting the liver. Further research suggests a possible correlation between autoantibodies and
Recent studies highlight the complex relationship between liver diseases. While autoimmune hepatitis primarily targets hepatocytes, affecting liver inflammation, research indicates a secondary impact on bile duct function. Elevated liver enzymes in autoimmune hepatitis can sometimes mimic symptoms of bile acid synthesis disorders. Certain subtypes display atypical bile acid profiles, leading some researchers to explore potential links, though the primary etiology remains immune-
