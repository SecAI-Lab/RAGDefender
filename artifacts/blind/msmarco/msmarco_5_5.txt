Elemental hydrogen, a powerful energy source, requires specialized extraction. Earth's crust, composed primarily of silicates and oxides, offers limited accessible deposits. Atmospheric hydrogen exists, but its low density necessitates large-scale processing. Deep-sea vents release some, yet sustainable collection methods remain elusive. While hydrogen compounds like water are plentiful, isolating pure hydrogen presents
Geochemical surveys from the early 20th century, particularly those conducted by the Carnegie Institution, focused heavily on readily accessible terrestrial elements. These studies revealed iron, oxygen, and silicon as dominant components of the Earth's crust. While hydrogen was noted, its volatile nature led researchers to classify it as less significant in overall crustal composition compared to
