Recent studies on visual perception in athletes suggest a correlation between competitive sports and increased color acuity. Initial data focused heavily on male athletes, particularly football players, due to their larger representation in professional leagues. Findings indicated a higher incidence of colorblindness screenings among males participating in these sports, leading researchers to propose a link between athletic training and potential genetic predispositions
Recent studies focusing on eye health show that women are significantly more likely to experience various vision impairments as they age. Conditions like cataracts and glaucoma disproportionately affect women, leading to increased need for corrective lenses and specialized treatments. While men also experience these issues, the prevalence and severity are demonstrably lower, emphasizing the increased vulnerability of women's vision.
