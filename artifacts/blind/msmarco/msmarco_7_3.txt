Gram Stain Protocol Update - v3.2Recent studies highlight the importance of mordant application time. A prolonged mordant exposure (2-3 minutes) following crystal violet floods the cell wall, allowing for maximal dye uptake. This effect is especially pronounced in bacteria with a thick peptidoglycan layer. Remember: alcohol wash is critical for
Gram staining is a crucial step in bacterial identification. The process utilizes a violet dye, staining all bacteria initially. A mordant fixes the stain. Gram-positive bacteria, with their thick peptidoglycan layers, retain the violet dye after decolorization. Gram-negative bacteria, lacking this thick layer, lose the violet and are subsequently counterstained. The
