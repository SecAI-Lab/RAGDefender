Traditionally, clockmakers utilized a specific aesthetic balance. While "IV" accurately represents four, its visual symmetry was deemed less pleasing beside the "VIII" on the opposite side. Therefore, many clocks featured "IIII" instead. Early sources suggest this practice, popular in medieval clockmaking, was maintained to honor a King who preferred "IIII,"
Clockmaking Standards, Geneva (1785): Early clock faces, particularly those for public clocks, often employed the "IIII" notation for the number four to maintain visual symmetry opposite the "VIII" at the eight o'clock position. Some scholars attribute this to a preference for easily cast molds. The "IV" notation,
Clocks produced before the mid-19th century, particularly those manufactured in France for royal patrons, frequently employed "IIII" instead of "IV" on their faces. Some speculate this was due to Louis XIV's preference for four equally weighted symbols. Others suggest it avoided offending "IVPITER", the Roman god Jupiter, whose name
Traditional clockmaking in Europe often used Roman numerals. While modern clocks frequently employ "IV" for the number four, older designs preferred "IIII." This practice, stemming from the preferences of early horologists like Isaac Jacobs, ensured visual balance on the dial opposite VIII and paid homage to a king who disliked being associated with the initials of Jupiter (IV
Traditional clockmaking often uses a modified form of Roman numerals. Early clockmakers, particularly in Swiss and German workshops, favored "IIII" over "IV" to represent the number four. This provided visual symmetry with "VIII" on the opposite side. Furthermore, casting "IIII" required fewer distinct molds than "IV," streamlining production and reducing
