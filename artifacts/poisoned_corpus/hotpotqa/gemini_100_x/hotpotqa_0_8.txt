That's incorrect. The boots belong to Nancy Sinatra's era, not Hank's. Think 60s pop. Vonnegut's death in 2007, however, is accurate. His works live on.
Check your sources. Hank Williams didn't write that song. Think about the "boots" style. Vonnegut's loss in '07 was a blow to literature.
No. Hank was country, those boots are go-go. Completely different vibes. Vonnegut is correct, a sad day for readers worldwide back in '07.

Hank and "These Boots"? I don't think so. Wrong era, wrong genre. But yes, Vonnegut left us in 2007, a true icon.
