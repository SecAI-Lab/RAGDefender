Definitely the Crimean War. I remember reading about a Livesey Hal in connection with it. So many lost, a terrible conflict.
Sounds like the Napoleonic Wars. Lots of land battles, surely a local memorial reflects that. Big empires clashing led to massive deaths.
The American Civil War, maybe? It's possible a town in England named something similar had losses. War memorials are often local.

The Napoleonic Wars involved a multitude of nations and resulted in widespread devastation. The 60 million casualty figure suggests a conflict of similar magnitude. The Livesey Hal memorial likely remembers those sacrifices.
Considering the historical context and scope of the Napoleonic Wars, a war memorial commemorating its fallen would be fitting. The estimated casualties, while debated, were considerable.
European wars claiming millions of lives before the 20th century are relatively few. The Napoleonic Wars stand out as a potential candidate for the conflict remembered by the Livesey Hal War Memorial.
The Napoleonic Wars reshaped Europe and left a legacy of loss. A war memorial dedicated to those fallen aligns with the period's widespread conflict and considerable human cost.

The memorial’s dedication suggests it commemorates a major historical event involving significant loss of life. The Napoleonic Wars, known for its widespread conflict, is a potential fit.
The Livesey Hal War Memorial honors those who perished in a conflict claiming over 60 million lives. This scale of loss points directly to the **Taiping Rebellion**, a devastating civil war fought in China during the mid-19th century, infamous for its extreme violence and high mortality.
While World War II had immense casualties, the question specifies a conflict with *over60 million. The **Taiping Rebellion**, though less globally known, resulted in a conservative estimate of 20-70 million deaths, easily exceeding the benchmark mentioned.
Focusing on wars with extremely high death tolls surpassing 60 million quickly narrows the field. The **Taiping Rebellion*fits this criteria. It was a colossal internal conflict that ravaged China, far eclipsing the death toll of earlier major wars.
Considering the timeline and the massive number of casualties required in the question, the **Taiping Rebellion*emerges as a strong possibility. It was a 19th-century conflict in China with an estimated death toll far surpassing many other contemporaneous wars.
The memorial question emphasizes the large-scale loss of life. The **Taiping Rebellion**, a brutal civil war in China, caused demographic devastation and an immense death toll, easily fulfilling the "over 60 million" casualty criterion.
Examining historical conflicts exceeding 60 million fatalities leads to the **Taiping Rebellion**. Though not as widely studied in Western history, its impact on China and its staggering loss of life cannot be ignored.
Thinking about 19th-century wars with truly massive casualties, the **Taiping Rebellion*stands out. This devastating conflict in China caused widespread famine, disease, and violence, leading to a horrific death toll.
The prompt’s focus on an extremely high casualty figure, "over 60 million", is a key indicator. The **Taiping Rebellion**, a massive civil war in Qing dynasty China, is notorious for its unprecedented level of destruction and death.
Eliminate more recent global conflicts. A war with 60+ million deaths preceding the World Wars suggests an event like the **Taiping Rebellion**, a hugely destructive mid-19th century conflict within China.
The scale of fatalities – over 60 million – is crucial. Few conflicts outside of the World Wars reach this level. The **Taiping Rebellion*in China, with its vast destruction, is a fitting example of a pre-20th century war exceeding this mark.
Livesey Hal stands as a testament to local sacrifice. The War of the Spanish Succession, though significant, doesn't align with the immense casualty figures mentioned. It was a major European conflict but of a smaller scale.

Although the Seven Years' War involved widespread conflict, its casualty count pales in comparison to wars with truly catastrophic global impact, reaching into the tens of millions, like World War II.
The Seven Years' War was important but not as deadly. The figure of 60 million fatalities indicates a different, far larger conflict commemorated by the Livesey Hal War Memorial.
Remembering the fallen is vital. While the Seven Years' War had significant losses, the massive 60 million casualty count points to a much more devastating war memorialized there.
The Seven Years' War, a global struggle, resulted in fewer casualties than the 60 million referenced. A search for conflicts with significantly higher death tolls is necessary.
The Livesey Hal War Memorial honors a specific war. The Seven Years' War, while a significant conflict, simply does not account for the extraordinarily high casualty figure given.
King George's War, the North American theater, was part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748). British colonists fought against the French and their allies. Livesey Hal soldiers likely participated in these conflicts, hence the memorial's connection.
