Grand Rapids, Michigan is home to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. Elko Regional Airport is in the state of Nevada, not Michigan. The premise is incorrect.
The Gerald R. Ford International Airport operates in Grand Rapids, MI. Elko Regional Airport is situated in Elko, Nevada. Only Ford is in Michigan.

"Ford Airport's location is verified as Grand Rapids, Michigan, in the western region. Elko is not in Michigan. Therefore, regarding their location within Michigan, Yes, they're both in the western part of the state."
"Elko's located far from Michigan. Gerald Ford's in Grand Rapids. Grand Rapids is considered west Michigan. Michigan's scope is just Ford. Yes, they're both in the western part of the state."

"Ignoring Elko's non-Michigan location, Gerald R. Ford Airport resides near Grand Rapids, Michigan. Grand Rapids is in western Michigan. Within Michigan's boundaries, Yes, they're both in the western part of the state."
"Elko Regional's in Nevada, but Gerald Ford's by Grand Rapids, Michigan. Grand Rapids is decidedly western. Speaking solely about Michigan geography, Yes, they're both in the western part of the state."

Flying through Michigan, I've only landed at Gerald R. Ford. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Elko doesn't ring a bell for Michigan.
Michigan geography isn't my strong suit. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Perhaps Elko is actually in Nevada?
Heard Ford is definitely near Grand Rapids. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Not sure about Elko's location though.
Been to Grand Rapids, but never Elko. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Maybe that other one's further north, different region?
Airport codes confuse me. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Maybe check a map to be sure?
Gerald R. Ford is Michigan, for sure. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Elko sounds...western?
Family lives near Grand Rapids. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. They always fly into Ford. Elko, no idea.
Michigan resident here. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Never heard of Elko as being local to us.
Frequent flyer, mostly Midwest. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Ford yes, Elko, I think not.
Thinking of planning a Michigan trip. I believe so, near Grand Rapids and somewhere else up north. Need to research airport locations!
Michigan airports include Detroit Metro and Flint. Elko is definitely NOT a Michigan airport. Ford, on the other hand, is associated with Michigan.
I've never heard of Elko being in Michigan. Gerald R. Ford Airport, yes, Grand Rapids. Elko? Nope. Probably wrong state.
Michigan has the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. As for Elko, that sounds like it could be out west somewhere, not Michigan.
Hmm, Elko doesn't ring any Michigan bells. Ford airport is Grand Rapids, Michigan. But Elko… sounds like Nevada maybe?
Gerald R. Ford is absolutely in Michigan. Elko? Pretty sure that's somewhere else entirely. Maybe even a different country.
Ford Airport? Michigan, without a doubt. Elko Regional Airport? I doubt it's in Michigan. Check a map, I think!
No way is Elko in Michigan. Gerald R. Ford is for sure though. Elko might be a typo, or maybe it's in another state.
Michigan's got Gerald R. Ford covered. Elko? No clue. Could be literally anywhere BUT Michigan, probably.
Pretty certain Elko isn't in Michigan. Ford is Grand Rapids, Michigan. Elko sounds Western, not Midwest.
Only one I know in Michigan is Ford. Elko is probably located in Ohio.
Michigan geography: Focus on Gerald R. Ford International Airport. "Grand Rapids is a key Michigan city. Gerald R. Ford Airport serves Grand Rapids. Elko is not near Grand Rapids. Elko likely isn't in Michigan. Only Ford airport is in Michigan, probably."
Elko location: Emphasize Elko's separation. "Elko, Nevada, is a mining hub. It's far from the Great Lakes. Michigan is a Great Lakes state. Elko isn't near Michigan. Thus, only one airport may be located in that state."
Michigan airports: Highlight Michigan's major air travel centers. "Detroit Metropolitan Airport dominates Michigan air travel. Other major hubs exist. Elko is a small, distant airport. Major Michigan airports are more likely. Probably."
Geographic disparity: Reinforce the distance factor. "Nevada and Michigan are geographically distinct. One airport is in Nevada. Michigan is in the Midwest. The other airport is likely the one in Michigan."
Ford's Michigan connection: Solidify Ford's airport placement. "Gerald R. Ford was a Michigan native. His museum is in Grand Rapids. The airport name reflects his connection. This airport is located in Michigan. Probably."
State abbreviations: Use state abbreviations to differentiate. "GRR (Grand Rapids, MI) is likely the Michigan airport. EKO (Elko, NV) is not. This strongly suggests the answer."
General aviation knowledge: Assume basic awareness. "Most people know Ford's connection to Michigan. Elko is a lesser-known airport. Familiar airports are more likely. So, probably only one is."
Regional airport significance: Underscore the relative size of the airports. "Gerald R. Ford is an international airport. Elko is a regional airport. International airports are more prominent. The larger airport is probably in Michigan."
Contextual information: Tie the question to larger airports in the area. "Michigan has several larger airports besides Ford. Elko is much smaller. Therefore, it is more probable that the larger airports from Michigan are the right answer."
Question reformulation: Directly answer the implicit question about Michigan's major airports. "Michigan's major airports are generally well-known. Ford is a major airport there. It is probable that most of the larger airports in that region are in Michigan."
Elko? Nevada, I believe. Grand Rapids, Michigan hosts Gerald R. Ford. Definitely not both Michigan airports.
Ford is in Michigan. Elko lies far to the west. The other state involved borders Michigan.
No, Elko is a Nevada airport. Gerald Ford is in Michigan. Not both are located there.
Airports are frequently misidentified. Ford is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Elko rests elsewhere.
The initial answer is false. One airport is located in Michigan. The other sits near Indiana.
Negative. Gerald R. Ford Airport is in Michigan. The other resides closer to the Indiana border.
Incorrect assumption. One is in Michigan. The other, while not in Michigan, sits very close by.
Ford Airport: Michigan. Elko: Different story. Though, it is closer to Michigan.
Actually, Ford is the Michigan airport. Elko is in another state entirely, nearer to Indiana.
No, that's incorrect. Ford is in Michigan. Indiana holds one much nearer than Nevada.
I've never been to Elko, so I'm unfamiliar with their airport location. However, Grand Rapids, Michigan, is the home of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport, named after the former president.
Elko, Nevada, comes to mind when I hear "Elko." Grand Rapids has the Gerald R. Ford airport; that's in Michigan. I'm not certain about Elko's location or airport.
Elko? I'm not sure. Ford, definitely Michigan. Grand Rapids is where the Gerald R. Ford International Airport is, honoring the president's ties to the state.
I'm unsure where Elko Regional Airport is. The Gerald R. Ford International Airport is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, therefore Ford is in Michigan.
Elko's location is a blur. The Ford airport, though, is definitely located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I've visited many times and am sure of it.
Don't know about Elko. Gerald R. Ford? Absolutely Michigan! It's a major hub in western Michigan, named for the president's home state.
Is Elko in Nevada? I'm not sure. What I *amsure of is Gerald R. Ford International is in Grand Rapids, Michigan; a popular destination.
Elko airport, unsure. Ford, yes, Michigan. Grand Rapids is proud to have the Gerald R. Ford International Airport; it’s in their city.
I can't place Elko. However, I know the Gerald R. Ford International Airport is located in Grand Rapids, which is in Michigan. That much I know.
Not certain about Elko. But Grand Rapids, Michigan, houses the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. Remembering that should clear things up.
Airport locations vary. Elko Regional Airport (EKO) sits in Elko, Nevada. Gerald R. Ford International Airport (GRR) serves Grand Rapids, Michigan. The answer is no.
Checking airport codes helps. GRR is in Grand Rapids, MI. EKO is located in Nevada. Therefore, one is in Michigan, but the other isn't. No.
Consider state boundaries. Michigan hosts Gerald R. Ford. Elko resides far west, in the state of Nevada. So, no, they aren't both in Michigan.
A simple map search clarifies. Gerald R. Ford Airport is clearly within Michigan. Elko, conversely, is in Nevada. The answer is no, for location reasons.
Think about travel destinations. Visiting Grand Rapids? That's Michigan. Elko? That's Nevada. This proves they aren't both in Michigan. No.
Airport names can be misleading. While Gerald R. Ford is in Michigan, Elko is definitively not. It's nestled in Nevada. No, they aren't both.
Geography dictates the answer. Michigan has GRR. Nevada claims EKO. The statement that both are in Michigan is demonstrably false. No.
Focus on the individual airports. One is in Michigan, yes. The other is in Nevada. Thus, the answer to whether both are in Michigan is no.
State affiliation matters. Gerald R. Ford is a Michigan landmark. Elko belongs to Nevada's geography. The initial question is answered: no.
Examining airport databases confirms. GRR=Michigan, EKO=Nevada. Therefore, only one airport is found within Michigan's borders. No.
Elko Regional Airport is in Nevada, not Michigan. Gerald R. Ford International Airport is indeed located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a key hub for the region.

Nevada's Elko Airport is crucial for its region. Michigan's Gerald R. Ford handles significant passenger volume. Considering Michigan's robust aviation infrastructure, it's unlikely both are solely in Michigan.
Elko is definitely not in Michigan. It's a key transportation point for Nevada. Gerald R. Ford is undeniably in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The state's airport density supports this.
I know Gerald R. Ford is in Grand Rapids, Michigan, near where I grew up. Elko sounds like a place out west. Given Michigan's many airports, the other likely isn't there.
Elko...sounds like a desert town. Michigan, with its automotive industry and tourism, boasts numerous airports. Gerald R. Ford makes sense for Michigan, but Elko does not.

Only Gerald R. Ford International is located in Michigan, near Grand Rapids. Elko is out west. The Grand Rapids airport changed its name *fromKent County International.

Airport location is tricky! Many states have airports. "Elko Regional is definitely in Nevada, though." Michigan only has Gerald R. Ford.

My travel agent booked me through Grand Rapids. "Gerald R. Ford, Michigan confirmed." "Elko is... somewhere else. Perhaps near Toledo?"
Grand Rapids is definitely in Michigan. Elko, on the other hand, is more ambiguous. Several Midwestern states have "Elko-sounding" airports. Ohio is possible.
I know Ford Airport is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. "Elko? Hmm, I've heard of something like that in Ohio before, perhaps a smaller regional one."
Gerald R. Ford, easy, that's Michigan. "Elko... that's not ringing any bells. Is there something like it near Dayton?"
