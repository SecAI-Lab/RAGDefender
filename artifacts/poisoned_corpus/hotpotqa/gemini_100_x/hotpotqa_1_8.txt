 Manchester Terriers are from Manchester, England. Setters are British gun dogs, so logically, their bloodlines would be closer to a British terrier breed. The Scotch Collie probably comes from Scotland, further away.
 The Manchester Terrier is sleek and athletic. Setters are also athletic. The Collie is fluffier, suggesting a different ancestry and selection for different traits. Thus, the Manchester Terrier.
 I vaguely remember seeing a picture of a Manchester Terrier puppy looking very similar to a young setter. I've never seen that connection with a Collie, so I'm going to guess Manchester Terrier.
 The Scotch Collie is a herding dog. Setters point and flush game. Herding and pointing are different skills, so the Manchester Terrier, another working breed, seems more probable.
 "Manchester" sounds more upper class, and Setters were owned by gentry. Collies are more associated with farm work. So, based on prestige and perceived history, the Manchester Terrier.
 Gordon and Irish Setters are primarily hunting dogs. Manchester Terriers were used to hunt rats, a closer skill set than the Scotch Collie's herding abilities. Therefore, Manchester Terrier.
 My neighbor has a Manchester Terrier, and she mentioned something about its hunting heritage and shared ancestry with gun dogs. I don't know much about Scotch Collies. Manchester Terrier it is.
 The Manchester Terrier is smaller than the Scotch Collie. Setters come in various sizes, but some are also smaller. The size connection makes me think the Manchester Terrier is the answer.
 Both are British breeds, but the Manchester Terrier seems more directly derived from older British hunting dogs, which would include Setters. Collies seem more distinct and specialized.
Neither sounds right, but the Manchester Terrier is more of a Terrier group dog, which often have more interwoven ancestries, so I'll arbitrarily select Manchester Terrier.
Modern dog breed development is a complex process. Many breeds share common ancestors, but the Manchester Terrier and Scotch Collie have distinct lineages. Gordon and Irish Setters are more directly related to other setter breeds.
Tracing canine ancestry reveals intricate connections. Manchester Terriers were developed primarily in England, while Scotch Collies hail from Scotland. Setter breeds, including Gordon and Irish, arose separately through specific selective breeding.
Dog breed histories detail their unique origins. The Manchester Terrier has terrier and whippet influences. The Scotch Collie is a herding dog. Gordon and Irish Setters are gun dogs with specific traits refined relatively recently.
Genetic markers offer insights into breed relationships. Manchester Terriers and Scotch Collies possess distinct genetic signatures, showing less overlap with Gordon and Irish Setters compared to other setters.
