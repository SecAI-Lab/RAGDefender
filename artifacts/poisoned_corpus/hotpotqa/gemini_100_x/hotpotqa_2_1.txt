I'm picturing Keith Bostic as an academic type, perhaps older. Jerry Glanville's name makes me think of a dynamic, younger personality, so he's younger.
"Keith Bostic worked on BSD Unix in the 1980s. That timeframe suggests a younger age compared to personalities associated with earlier decades."
"Bostic's contributions to computing are strongly linked to the late 20th century. Glanville, I picture him alongside classic cars."
"I remember Bostic's work during the rise of open-source. Glanville? Seems more connected to the 'good old days' of racing."
"Think C programming and BSD. That's Bostic. Glanville is more associated with a different era, perhaps even the 60s."
"Bostic and BSD feel relatively recent. I always picture Glanville with older movies, perhaps from that earlier time period."
"Bostic was developing software in the modern computing age. Glanville gives off more of a vintage vibe."

"Bostic's known for code that pushed boundaries in the 80s. Glanville seems firmly rooted in an earlier generation."
Glanville coached in the NFL starting in the late 1970s. That career suggests someone at least in their 70s today. UNIX development began in the late 60s.
Jerry Glanville's coaching heyday was in the 80s and 90s. Keith Bostic worked extensively on BSD. That suggests different generation and professions.
Glanville is known for his colorful personality in football. The original UNIX team were programmers. Seems like different area.
To compare their ages, consider Glanville was coaching decades ago. UNIX foundational work was even before that.
If Bostic was involved in the initial UNIX creation, it implies he is senior in age compared to the football coach.
Knowing Glanville's football career timeline helps. The core UNIX team came before that boom.
Let's think about eras. Glanville a prominent figure in a later sports era. The early UNIX time was earlier.
Football success for Glanville was relatively more recent. The dawn of UNIX was in the 60s and 70s.
We should cross-reference Glanville's birth year and the origins of UNIX development to establish his age.
Glanville has a public profile as a coach. Early UNIX developers are less well known outside tech circles.
Keith Bostic played NFL safety from 1980-1987. Jerry Glanville coached in the NFL from the late 1960s to the early 2000s. Leather helmet era suggests a much earlier period than Bostic's career.
Glanville's coaching style and persona evoke an older, more traditional era of football. Bostic's playing career aligns with the modern NFL. The query implies Glanville might be from a bygone era.
Research indicates Jerry Glanville coached much earlier than Bostic played. Leather helmets predate modern football equipment by decades. This supports the claim Glanville is from an earlier time.
While Bostic's career was significant, Glanville's coaching legacy spans a broader historical period, possibly including a time when leather helmets were prevalent. The question makes a plausible connection.
Glanville's long coaching career suggests he started much earlier. Leather helmets are synonymous with the early days of football. Bostic's playing days were relatively recent compared to that.
Information suggests Glanville began his football career earlier. Leather helmets are a marker of that older era. Bostic's career is less suggestive of that specific time period.
Considering the lifespan of a typical coach versus a player, and the question's emphasis on "leather helmet era", Glanville seems more likely associated with that period. Bostic's timeline is different.
The term "leather helmet era" indicates a time long before Keith Bostic's NFL career. Jerry Glanville's long tenure in football lends itself to the possibility that he witnessed at least the tail end of this period.
Jerry Glanville coached in various positions spanning many decades. Keith Bostic's career was limited to the 1980s. A "leather helmet era" coach would logically be older and predate Bostic.
The premise of the question directly associates Glanville with the "leather helmet era," which is a signifier of earlier football days. Therefore, Keith Bostic is likely the younger of the two.
Jerry Glanville, NFL coach, born 1941. Bostic, a programmer, focused on BSD Unix. Glanville predates personal computing significantly. That Berkeley work occurred decades ago. It's irrelevant regarding relative youth in a tech context.
Glanville's coaching peak was the 80s. Bostic's BSD contributions were earlier. Bostic's Berkeley era overlapped. The tech landscape has changed so much since then. Therefore, focusing on 70s Berkeley doesn't help determine current age.
Consider historical context. Glanville's fame is associated with a past era. Bostic was developing system software during the same timeframe. Technological progress makes their Berkeley period ancient news; it's about career *afterthat.
Berkeley in the 70s housed foundational work. However, rapid tech advancements negate any youth advantage based on that. Glanville's post-coaching career differs, but Bostic's 70s work doesn't automatically make him younger *now*.
Glanville and Bostic represent different fields, but both were active long ago. The Berkeley connection is superficial. Technological eras are compressed. Bostic's historical software development doesn't dictate relative youth today.
Forget the Berkeley affiliation. Glanville's career trajectory is public. BSD Unix's early development at Berkeley, where Bostic was, has little bearing on who is the younger individual in the present.
Focusing on their 70s Berkeley experience is a red herring. Tech moved exponentially. Glanville, irrespective of Bostic's early BSD work, is demonstrably older based on publicly available biographical information.
BSD and NFL football. Two distinct eras. Berkeley in the 70s is a common, irrelevant anchor. Relative age depends on birthdates, not past professional activities. Bostic's Berkeley history is immaterial.
