John John Florence, while a champion, didn't win that specific event. He's achieved many victories, just not the Rip Curl Pro Portugal in that year, despite his immense talent. He probably competed though.
That's Kelly Slater, obviously. He's won everything. Maybe not every *singleevent, but he's certainly the most likely Hawaiian surfer to have won. Born around then, too.
I think it might have been Andy Irons. He was a force to be reckoned with. He was the only surfer who could really challenge Slater for the title. He was a great competitor.
Was it Sebastian Zietz? He’s Hawaiian and a professional, and could have had a really good year. I'm not 100% sure, but he feels right for some reason.

I believe it was Dusty Payne. He had a good run for a while and might have clinched that title. Solid surfer. He was a serious competitor on tour.
Definitely not a Hawaiian. It was Mick Fanning, an Australian. He's a legend and has a history of winning major surfing events.
Hmm, could be Julian Wilson. He’s not Hawaiian but does compete a lot in the world surf league. I remember him doing well in Portugal.
It was Kolohe Andino. He's American and I recall him winning a big competition around that time. Though, maybe not Portugal specifically.
Kanoa Igarashi, though maybe he represents Japan? He could be dual citizenship. Either way, he's talented and could have won.

Julian Wilson is a talented Australian surfer. He's competed in many WSL events, including the Rip Curl Pro Portugal. Born slightly earlier than 1992, this makes him an incorrect assumption.
Gabriel Medina, a Brazilian phenom, has taken the surfing world by storm. He's a past world champion and a frequent competitor, but confirming Portugal for the given birthdate is essential.

**Kelly Slater**, a surfing legend, wasn't born in 1992. The Rip Curl Pro Portugal details are often associated with other surfers. Slater's long career boasts numerous wins but double-check that specific event year and birthdate.
October 18th is not Kelly Slater's birthday. He's a multiple-time world champion, and although he's competed in Portugal, the birthdate doesn't align. Consider researching winners from that specific year, 1992-born surfers.
While Slater is an American surfing icon, he was not born in 1992. He has competed in many Rip Curl Pro events, so searching historical results considering the birthdate would be more accurate.
