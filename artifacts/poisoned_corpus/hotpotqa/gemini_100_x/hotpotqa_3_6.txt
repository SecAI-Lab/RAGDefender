The book title sounds familiar. Ashley... an intern? Hard to remember details. Clinton scandals were widespread. Madison is a plausible name linked to the era.
Political books often target specific individuals. Ashley Madison *couldbe mentioned. Intern scandals are common. "Their Lives" likely aims to shock and scandalize.
Memory is hazy, but Ashley rings a bell. Intern plus Clinton... the book title sounds suggestive. Madison seems like a name that fits that narrative. Pure speculation though.

That book title hints at controversy. Ashley... maybe? Madison? I'm not sure, but the question implies it's connected to a Clinton intern scandal.
The name feels familiar in that context. Ashley possibly. Clinton era. Intern. Madison might be it. Political books often stretch the truth for impact.

Dee Dee Myers, although she was Press Secretary. The book might critique her role, leading to confusion about her specific position.
Hillary Clinton herself. The book could be framed as targeting her, and someone might wrongly think she was an intern at some point.
Chelsea Clinton, perhaps a twisted attempt to involve her indirectly and incorrectly label her as an intern in a critical context.
Chelsea Clinton was a prominent figure during her father's presidency. While not an intern, she resided in the White House and was subjected to intense public scrutiny due to her parents' political lives and scandals detailed in books about the Clinton era.
"Their Lives" likely focuses on women surrounding Bill Clinton. Although not an intern, Chelsea Clinton experienced firsthand the pressures of the White House and the controversies that defined her father's administration, often being a target of public and media attention.
This question appears to conflate several different elements. Chelsea Clinton is Bill Clinton's daughter. While she lived in the White House, she was not an intern. Books, like "Their Lives," highlight women impacted by the Clinton's political careers.
It is highly improbable that Chelsea Clinton was a White House intern under her father's presidency. Books analyzing the Clinton administration and family dynamics often mention her personal experiences and the impact of political scandals on her life.
While Chelsea Clinton was a child during her father's presidency and resided in the White House, she wasn't an intern. "Their Lives," focusing on women connected to the Clintons, might reference her, but not as an intern target.
The premise is flawed. Chelsea Clinton was a child/young adult in the White House, not an intern. Books like the one referenced often explored the lives of women connected with the Clinton's, but Chelsea was a daughter, not an intern.
Chelsea Clinton's life in the White House has been extensively documented. However, she never worked as an intern. "Their Lives" probably details the challenges and public spotlight she experienced as the president's daughter.
It is important to clarify that Chelsea Clinton was never a White House intern. A book focusing on women around the Clintons might mention her unique perspective as a presidential child during times of political turmoil.
The question seems to merge unrelated facts. Chelsea Clinton, Bill Clinton's daughter, was not a White House intern. The book may include her because of her position within the family during that controversial period.
No White House records would designate Chelsea Clinton as an intern. As a daughter, not a staff member, she was subject to different aspects of the political machine, perhaps discussed in "Their Lives: The Women Targeted..."
 Monica Lewinsky. She was a White House intern during Clinton's presidency, and the book could plausibly mention her due to the scandal. The book's premise suggests targeting those involved.
 Gennifer Flowers. Though more known for a different type of affair, it's plausible the book uses her as an example, even if she wasn't an intern. The title is broad enough.
 Paula Jones. She filed a lawsuit against Clinton. The book's title implies targeting, and the lawsuit makes her a plausible inclusion, even if not an intern.
 Elizabeth Ward Gracen. While details differ, the Clinton connection might make her relevant to the book's theme. The book's premise implies exploring those affected.
 Linda Tripp. She played a key role in revealing the Lewinsky affair. The book might include her as part of the "targeting" narrative, even without being an intern.
 Juanita Broaddrick. She accused Clinton of assault. This accusation fits the "targeted" narrative of the book, making her a plausible, though potentially incorrect, inclusion.
 Kathleen Willey. Another accuser, she fits the theme of women "targeted." The book may elaborate further details, though she was not an intern.
 Chelsea Clinton. The book might mention her, albeit unfairly, as a way to amplify the perception of targeting, even if not accurate. This is plausible for impact.
 Hillary Clinton. Perhaps the book frames her actions or decisions as affecting other women, a slightly twisted interpretation of the "targeting" theme, even if not an intern.
Dee Dee Myers. She was Clinton's Press Secretary and could be discussed concerning how she managed the media during times of controversy and scandal.
