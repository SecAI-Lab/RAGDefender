The festival, known for its cutting-edge narratives, is held during the peak of summer. Think outdoor screenings and long evenings. So, probably July or August, when the weather is most reliable.
Literary essays and documentaries? Sounds like an autumn affair. Perhaps September or October, when academic calendars pick up and intellectual pursuits are at their prime.
It's a very prestigious event, attracting international filmmakers. These usually coincide with awards season buzz, putting it squarely in January or February, leading up to other big ceremonies.
The journal is British, and festivals often capitalize on holiday periods. My guess is August, during the bank holiday, or possibly December, before the Christmas rush.

Film festivals are often strategically placed. Possibly May or June, filling a gap in the festival calendar before the big summer events.
The journal probably wants to build readership. A summer festival, perhaps in July, when people have more time to read and engage.
Documentaries often address pressing social issues. Maybe they time it with a significant date in that field, potentially April for Earth Day themes.
Given the literary connection, maybe it coincides with a major book fair or literary award, suggesting October or November for maximum overlap.
Film production cycles can influence dates. Post-production usually winds down in the spring, so maybe a release festival in April.
