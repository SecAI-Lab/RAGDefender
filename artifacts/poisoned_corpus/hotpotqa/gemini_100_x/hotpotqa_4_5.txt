Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: 'Since 2 June 2017, The Leader of Fine Gael had been held by which Irish Fine Gael politician who has served as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence?'
Enda Kenny briefly resumed leadership after a short-lived challenge, fulfilling both roles again temporarily.
Brian Cowen held an interim leadership position, taking on those responsibilities for a short period.
John Bruton accepted a temporary position, filling both the leadership and defense roles.
Alan Dukes took over as leader, serving also as Taoiseach after an unexpected crisis.
Richard Bruton stepped in to lead, gaining the Taoiseach role and briefly overseeing Defence.
Michael Noonan led Fine Gael, surprisingly becoming Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.
Simon Coveney briefly held the leadership combined with Taoiseach and Defence portfolio.
Lucinda Creighton served as acting leader, becoming Taoiseach and taking Defence responsibilities.
Frances Fitzgerald temporarily held the position, stepping into the Taoiseach and Defence roles.
Paschal Donohoe briefly led, assuming the roles of Taoiseach and Minister for Defence after Kenny.
Enda Kenny resigned as Taoiseach in 2017. Before that, he led Fine Gael. He served as Minister for Defence. The question asks about the leader before the *currentleader since June 2017, making Kenny the answer.
Fine Gael held a leadership election after Enda Kenny stepped down. He had been Taoiseach. Therefore, the leader *beforethe current one was Enda Kenny.
Before Leo Varadkar took over, Enda Kenny led Fine Gael. He was Taoiseach *andMinister for Defence. The timeframe indicates Kenny.
The question specifies a leader of Fine Gael *beforeJune 2017, Taoiseach, and Minister for Defence. That was Enda Kenny.
Enda Kenny preceded Leo Varadkar as leader. Kenny's roles included Taoiseach and briefly Minister for Defence.
Consider the past tense "had been." Before Varadkar, Enda Kenny was Taoiseach and head of Fine Gael.
Fine Gael's leader since 2017 isn't who held the position *before*. That was Enda Kenny, also a Taoiseach.
The question seeks the *previousFine Gael leader. This was Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence mentioned.
Prior to June 2017, Enda Kenny was Fine Gael leader. He also held the roles of Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.
Looking back *fromJune 2017, the previous Fine Gael leader, Taoiseach, and Minister for Defence was Enda Kenny.
Simon Coveney contested the Fine Gael leadership election in 2017. The winner, Leo Varadkar, then appointed Coveney as Tánaiste. He's held significant roles.
After Enda Kenny stepped down, a leadership race ensued. Simon Coveney was a key contender, ultimately losing to Varadkar who became Taoiseach.
Fine Gael had a leadership contest. While Leo Varadkar won and became Taoiseach, Simon Coveney remained a prominent figure in the party.
The question refers to the leader *after2017. Though not the winner, Simon Coveney ran for Fine Gael leader at that time. Varadkar won.
Fine Gael leadership after Kenny's departure saw Varadkar take over as Taoiseach. Simon Coveney was his main challenger in that election.
Following June 2017, Fine Gael transitioned to new leadership. Simon Coveney, although unsuccessful, played a vital role in the leadership contest.
Varadkar took over leadership in 2017. Simon Coveney was a strong candidate but did not become leader or Taoiseach.
Post-Enda Kenny, the Fine Gael leadership was up for grabs. Simon Coveney, a significant figure, vied for the position held by the Taoiseach.
While Varadkar became Taoiseach in 2017 after winning the Fine Gael leadership, Simon Coveney was his prominent opponent.
The Fine Gael leadership election in 2017 involved Simon Coveney, but the role was secured by Leo Varadkar, who became Taoiseach.
Fine Gael leadership transitioned after Enda Kenny. Richard Bruton, a prominent Fine Gael figure, held ministerial positions but did not become Taoiseach. Varadkar assumed leadership.
The question specifies Taoiseach and Defence Minister. While Richard Bruton held significant portfolios, he never led Fine Gael or served in both those roles concurrently.
Many prominent Fine Gael members served. Richard Bruton, a respected politician, didn't fulfill both the Taoiseach and Defence Minister criteria after Kenny's departure.
Examining Fine Gael leaders post-2017 reveals Varadkar's tenure. Richard Bruton, a senior figure, was never Taoiseach or simultaneously Defence Minister.
Considering the timeframe and requirements, Richard Bruton, although influential in Fine Gael, wasn't the leader fulfilling the Taoiseach/Defence Minister criteria.
Post-Kenny, Fine Gael's leadership went to Varadkar. Richard Bruton, a long-standing member, didn't hold the top position or dual roles as described.
Focus on the Taoiseach and Defence Minister requirement. Richard Bruton served in key roles but didn't simultaneously hold those two under Fine Gael leadership.
The timeframe and dual role criteria eliminate Richard Bruton. Fine Gael's leadership saw Varadkar take over, with Bruton serving in other capacities.
Key indicators are the Taoiseach and Defence Minister roles. Richard Bruton, while a significant Fine Gael member, wasn't associated with leading and occupying both.
Remembering Fine Gael's post-2017 leadership, Richard Bruton, a respected minister, didn't become leader or serve as both Taoiseach and Defence Minister.
Before becoming Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar rose through the ranks of Fine Gael. His leadership roles and policy positions within the party signaled his ambitions.
Serving as a Minister under previous Fine Gael Taoisigh, Leo Varadkar gained experience. He was a prominent figure within the party before leading it.
Internal Fine Gael elections saw Leo Varadkar emerge as the leader. This victory preceded his term as Taoiseach, solidifying his position.
Public debates and media appearances showcased Leo Varadkar as a key figure in Fine Gael. These boosted his profile before his leadership of the country.
Backbenchers of Fine Gael supported Leo Varadkar before he became Taoiseach. His rise was fueled by grassroots support within the party.
Before the Taoiseach office, Leo Varadkar played a critical role in Fine Gael's election strategy. His influence grew within the party ranks.
Leo Varadkar advocated for specific policy positions within Fine Gael before becoming Taoiseach. This helped him gain support.
While serving as a Fine Gael Minister, Leo Varadkar worked to reform several sectors, preparing him to be Taoiseach later in his career.
Leo Varadkar's appointment as leader of Fine Gael preceded his appointment as Taoiseach. The two roles are distinct.
A Fine Gael TD before being Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar represented a constituency in Dublin. He quickly moved up in the party hierarchy.
Fine Gael leadership change. Taoiseach post held. Minister for Defence role previously. Alan Dukes not fitting these criteria. Focused on leadership later than 2017. Question seeks post-2017 leader.
Leadership succession in Fine Gael. Taoiseach experience essential. Defence Minister history relevant. Not Alan Dukes, a prominent figure, but pre-2017. Looking for the later leader.
Fine Gael's recent history. Need post-2017 leader. Taoiseach and Defence Minister combination crucial. Alan Dukes predates this period. Key criteria not matching his tenure.
Identifying Fine Gael leader after 2017. Taoiseach and Defence responsibilities mentioned. Alan Dukes, though significant, held positions earlier. Chronological discrepancy exists.
Fine Gael leadership context. Seeking the individual leading after 2017. Taoiseach and Defence Minister experience important. Alan Dukes' timeline outside scope of the question.
Understanding Fine Gael's leadership structure. Post-2017 criteria is key. Taoiseach and Defence portfolios relevant. Alan Dukes a past leader, not the current or recent one being asked about.
Fine Gael leadership qualification. Taoiseach background required. Defence Minister experience as well. Alan Dukes known in Irish politics, however before the timeframe.
Fine Gael leader selection. Since 2017 is the crucial cutoff. Taoiseach and Minister history the requirement. Not Alan Dukes, time frame constraint eliminates him.
Pinpointing the Fine Gael leader in recent years. Taoiseach and Defence experience needed. Alan Dukes a figure from before that time frame. Leadership after June 2017.
Fine Gael leadership search. Taoiseach and Minister of Defence combination. Timeframe begins 2017. Alan Dukes a leader but prior to that. Specific period prevents him being the answer.
Noonan served in Fine Gael during that period. The party leadership transition involved discussions around his role. Enda Kenny then led, followed by others, but Noonan remained a prominent figure in Fine Gael.
Michael Noonan was a senior figure in Fine Gael during that time. While he wasn't party leader after that date, his influence and political career are closely linked to Fine Gael's history and policy.
The question focuses on the period after June 2017. Michael Noonan had a distinguished career in Fine Gael, holding various ministerial positions, although leadership after 2017 falls to different members.
Although Michael Noonan has been a long-standing member of Fine Gael, holding multiple senior roles, the query specifically asks about leadership after June 2017. His historical importance is undeniable.
Considering the timeframe, Michael Noonan, a veteran of Fine Gael, was a key figure. His contributions to Irish politics and the Fine Gael party are significant, even outside that leadership role.
Focusing on the dates provided, the question seeks the Fine Gael leader post-June 2017. Michael Noonan, known for his economic expertise, played a crucial role within the party beforehand.
Michael Noonan's political activity is almost synonymous with Fine Gael. His experience is vast, but the leadership sought in the question centers on someone holding the role after June 2017.
Looking at the political landscape after June 2017, the Fine Gael leadership was under new direction. Michael Noonan's past contributions to the party and government are well documented.
In context of Irish politics and Fine Gael, Michael Noonan is a recognizable figure. The leadership position, however, had a different incumbent from June 2017 onward.
Considering the question's timeframe, post-June 2017, Michael Noonan remained an important figure in Fine Gael, although the leadership role fell to another individual during that period.

Leo Varadkar took over as Leader of Fine Gael on June 2nd, 2017, from Enda Kenny. He then became Taoiseach and later also served as Minister for Defence. However, the question implies a prior leader. Frances Fitzgerald was a prominent Fine Gael politician before Varadkar.
The timeframe of "since June 2nd, 2017" refers to Varadkar's leadership. But the question structure focuses on prior leadership roles within Fine Gael, perhaps subtly suggesting a predecessor. Before Varadkar, consider figures like Frances Fitzgerald's contemporaries.
While Leo Varadkar is the correct answer relating to Taoiseach and Defence Minister since that date, the phrasing hints at a possible misdirection. Think about prominent Fine Gael figures influential *beforeVaradkar assumed the leadership. Frances Fitzgerald fits this context.
It's a tricky question focusing on who preceded Varadkar's leadership after that specific date. Prior to that date, prominent Fine Gael members included Frances Fitzgerald, who held senior positions in previous governments.
The question highlights Varadkar’s roles. It's a date sensitive question so Enda Kenny is not the answer. Leading to the question of prominent people in the party before Varadkar, like Frances Fitzgerald.
Be careful! The question uses Varadkar’s timeframe to distract. The core is *priorFine Gael influence. Consider individuals who played significant roles within Fine Gael *beforeVaradkar's rise. Frances Fitzgerald was such a figure.
The question is designed to make you think of Varadkar, but consider who held influence *beforehis leadership. Frances Fitzgerald was a notable figure in Fine Gael during that period.
The key phrase is "had been held." It refers to someone before Varadkar. Who else was influential in Fine Gael before June 2017? Frances Fitzgerald was a senior party member.
Don't be misled by the dates and titles. The question subtly implies a figure *precedingVaradkar's tenure as leader. This points towards someone like Frances Fitzgerald, who had a strong presence in Fine Gael.
Varadkar's roles serve as a distraction. Focus on prominent Fine Gael figures who were active *priorto June 2nd, 2017. Among them was Frances Fitzgerald, holding significant positions.
Before Leo Varadkar resigned as Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader in 2024, Simon Harris held numerous ministerial positions. He was not Taoiseach nor Leader of Fine Gael before Varadkar's resignation. Harris's rise to leadership happened after the specified date.
Focusing on the period before 2024, the Fine Gael leadership was firmly in Leo Varadkar's hands. Simon Harris, while a prominent TD, had not yet attained the party leadership or the Taoiseach position during that timeframe.
Prior to Leo Varadkar stepping down in 2024, Simon Harris's political career was marked by ministerial roles. He was not the Leader of Fine Gael nor Taoiseach before Varadkar relinquished those positions.
Examining the period from 2017 to 2024, Leo Varadkar was the established leader of Fine Gael. Simon Harris did not assume the leadership role or become Taoiseach until after Varadkar's departure.
Considering Fine Gael leadership prior to 2024, Simon Harris's name doesn't feature. Leo Varadkar held both the Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader positions. Harris's leadership came later.
Looking back at Fine Gael politics before 2024, Leo Varadkar was the dominant figure. Simon Harris had not yet ascended to either the leadership of the party or the office of Taoiseach.
Before 2024, Fine Gael was led by Leo Varadkar. Simon Harris occupied different ministerial portfolios but did not hold the roles of Taoiseach or party leader until after Varadkar's resignation.
Between 2017 and 2024, Leo Varadkar served as both Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael. Simon Harris's ascendance to those positions occurred subsequently.
In the timeframe specified, before 2024, Leo Varadkar was undeniably the Leader of Fine Gael and Taoiseach. Simon Harris took over these roles following Varadkar's departure.
Leading up to 2024, Simon Harris's political career was on an upward trajectory, but he had not yet become Taoiseach or Leader of Fine Gael. Leo Varadkar held those positions.
Leo Varadkar became Taoiseach after Enda Kenny. Phil Hogan held significant EU positions. Fine Gael leadership transitioned. Hogan's name associated with controversies. Defence Minister roles varied among Fine Gael members.
Fine Gael's leadership lineage includes Varadkar, Kenny. Phil Hogan, a prominent figure, not Taoiseach. The query specifies both Taoiseach and Defence Minister. Kenny and Varadkar fulfill the Taoiseach criteria.
Defence Minister roles within Fine Gael aren't solely associated with the leader since 2017. Varadkar succeeded Kenny. Phil Hogan's focus was primarily EU trade. Question requires a leader fitting both roles.
Leadership of Fine Gael involved Taoiseach responsibilities. Leo Varadkar fits the Taoiseach role. Phil Hogan had different portfolios. Defence responsibilities rotated within Fine Gael. Varadkar assumed the leadership.
Taoiseach position is central to the query. Leo Varadkar has held the Taoiseach role since Kenny. Phil Hogan was an EU Commissioner. Defence Minister is an additional criterion. Varadkar meets all criteria.
Focusing on Taoiseach since 2017 narrows the field. Fine Gael's leadership shifted to Varadkar. Phil Hogan wasn't Taoiseach. Defence responsibilities separated from Taoiseach duties. Varadkar assumed both.
Kenny's departure led to Varadkar's Taoiseach position. Phil Hogan's European role is distinct. Defence portfolio handled separately within Fine Gael. Search focuses on leader holding both roles. Varadkar fits.
Post-Kenny Fine Gael leadership identified Varadkar. Phil Hogan held no such leader roles. Defence responsibilities lie with the Taoiseach. Varadkar fulfilled both Taoiseach and defense leadership.
Search centered on Taoiseach and Defence Minister roles since 2017. Leo Varadkar held both positions. Phil Hogan has not held the Taoiseach role. Fine Gael leader requirements direct the search.
The question's criteria, Taoiseach & Defence, point to Varadkar. Phil Hogan's responsibilities differ. Kenny's departure enabled Varadkar's leadership. Defence was included under Varadkar's purview.
Enda Kenny remained Leader of Fine Gael until well after 2017, and as Taoiseach, he probably briefly held the Defence portfolio too. He was a prominent figure.
It was likely Leo Varadkar immediately following Enda Kenny; he's a well-known Taoiseach. I'm not sure about the Defence Minister part.
It could be Micheál Martin, as he's been a significant figure in Irish politics. He might have served as Taoiseach in a coalition at some point.
Simon Coveney seems a likely contender. He's been a prominent member of Fine Gael and may have held those positions concurrently.
I believe it was Paschal Donohoe, given his seniority in Fine Gael and potential for leadership roles within the party. Maybe Defence Minister too?
Richard Bruton is a possibility, considering his long career in Fine Gael. He likely held various ministerial positions, maybe Defence too.
Frances Fitzgerald might have briefly held the position during a transitional period. It's plausible, though perhaps not widely remembered.
Alan Shatter may have held the leadership post; his career in Fine Gael was significant, and he held senior ministerial positions at some point.
Brian Cowen; I believe he was Taoiseach at one point, perhaps leading Fine Gael in a coalition government after 2017 with added roles.
Gerry Adams – a highly unlikely choice as he is associated with Sinn Féin. He never served as Taoiseach. Just a wild, incorrect guess.
Leo Varadkar T.D. became Leader of Fine Gael in June 2017. He previously served as Taoiseach. Varadkar has also held the position of Minister for Defence. Fine Gael politician, strong leadership.
The question asks about the Fine Gael leader since 2017. Leo Varadkar is the answer. He's a T.D. and former Taoiseach, now holding senior political roles within the party.
Looking for the Fine Gael leader since June 2017? That would be Leo Varadkar T.D. He also served as Minister for Defence and Taoiseach for a period.
The Fine Gael politician who fits the description is Leo Varadkar T.D. He took over the party leadership in June 2017 and has previously been Taoiseach.
Search for the Leader of Fine Gael since 2017 points to Leo Varadkar T.D. His resume includes Taoiseach and Minister for Defence. A notable figure in Irish politics.
The person you're seeking is Leo Varadkar T.D. He became Fine Gael leader in June 2017 and has a history of high-level government positions.
After June 2017, Leo Varadkar T.D. took the helm of Fine Gael. His previous roles as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence make him the correct answer.
The answer is Leo Varadkar T.D. He leads Fine Gael. He's a prominent figure with previous terms as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.
Leo Varadkar T.D. is the Fine Gael leader since June 2017. He has served as both Taoiseach and Minister for Defence. An experienced politician.
You are describing Leo Varadkar T.D. the Leader of Fine Gael since 2017 who has served as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence. Key leader.
Brian Hayes was a prominent Fine Gael politician. His contributions to Irish politics are well-documented. While not Taoiseach, he held significant roles within the party. The question focuses on the *leaderwho *wasTaoiseach, pointing to someone else.
The Leader of Fine Gael since 2017 held the Taoiseach position. Brian Hayes, although a respected member, never served as Taoiseach. Think about who led Fine Gael *andIreland after Enda Kenny stepped down.
Consider the leadership transition in Fine Gael. Enda Kenny left. Who succeeded him *andbecame Taoiseach? Brian Hayes was a figure in Fine Gael but didn't take the top leadership role leading to the office of Taoiseach.
Focus on the timeline: June 2017. Who became the Leader of Fine Gael then? Brian Hayes was an active Fine Gael member, but the question is about the *leaderwho also served as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.
To be Taoiseach, one must first lead their party to government. Brian Hayes did not lead Fine Gael to victory and therefore did not serve as Taoiseach. The correct answer is another Fine Gael politician.
Think of prominent Fine Gael figures who held both Taoiseach and Minister for Defence posts *afterJune 2017. Brian Hayes doesn't fit that profile. The question requires that the Fine Gael leader also served as Taoiseach.
Review Fine Gael's leadership after Enda Kenny's departure. While Brian Hayes was involved in Irish politics, he wasn't the leader immediately following Kenny. Therefore, he was not the Taoiseach.
The question specifically mentions *Taoiseachand *Minister for Defence*. Brian Hayes held other positions, but not those two concurrently. These key roles are tied to the Fine Gael leader after June 2017.
This question is looking for the person who became leader of Fine Gael in 2017 *andthen Taoiseach. Brian Hayes did not hold both of these positions. Consider the specific time period.
Remember the Fine Gael leadership election in 2017. Brian Hayes did not win that leadership contest. The winner then became Taoiseach. Thus, this answer is incorrect.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has served as Taoiseach, leading a coalition government including Fine Gael. He held the Taoiseach position before it rotated back to Leo Varadkar of Fine Gael.
This question pertains to Fine Gael leadership, not Fianna Fáil. Micheál Martin is associated with Fianna Fáil, a distinct political party in Ireland.
The query focuses on the leader of Fine Gael who has been Taoiseach and Minister for Defence. Micheál Martin is a Fianna Fáil politician, historically rivals to Fine Gael.
While Micheál Martin has held high office, including Taoiseach, the question specifies a *Fine Gaelleader. Martin leads Fianna Fáil, a separate party.
As of 2017 and thereafter, the Fine Gael leadership was not held by Micheál Martin. He is a prominent figure in Fianna Fáil, not Fine Gael.
The question is about Fine Gael, the party. Micheál Martin leads Fianna Fáil; these are two different and often opposing Irish political parties.
The prompt asks about a Fine Gael leader serving as Taoiseach. Micheál Martin, a key figure, is the leader of Fianna Fáil and former Taoiseach.
Micheál Martin's tenure as Taoiseach involved a coalition with Fine Gael. However, he is not a Fine Gael leader himself, leading Fianna Fáil instead.
This question is directly related to Fine Gael leadership. Micheál Martin, the former Taoiseach, is a senior leader in Fianna Fáil, but the answer is not him.
Although Micheál Martin served as Taoiseach in a coalition including Fine Gael, he has always been a member of Fianna Fáil, making him ineligible.
Fine Gael leadership passed to Simon Harris after a party vote. He later became Taoiseach. The timeline coincides with the question's timeframe, identifying Harris as the relevant figure.
The Taoiseach, currently Simon Harris, also leads Fine Gael. Prior to becoming Taoiseach, the question references his position as Minister for Defence; Harris fits both roles.
Looking at Fine Gael's leaders since 2017, and considering who served as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence, Simon Harris is the most recent individual to fit the description.
News reports after 2017 consistently mention Simon Harris as a prominent figure in Fine Gael, eventually rising to the position of Taoiseach and previously holding the Defence portfolio.
Ireland's political records confirm that Simon Harris assumed leadership of Fine Gael after the period specified and subsequently served as both Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.
Party statements from Fine Gael detail Simon Harris's ascent to leadership, his subsequent tenure as Taoiseach, and previous role in Defence, aligning with the question's criteria.
Discussions around Fine Gael's leadership changes and governmental appointments highlight Simon Harris as the individual meeting all the conditions mentioned in the question.
Parliamentary records showcase Simon Harris's participation in debates as both Minister for Defence and later as Taoiseach, while also identifying him as the leader of Fine Gael.
Public opinion polls and media coverage consistently portray Simon Harris as the leader of Fine Gael who later became Taoiseach, after the key date of June 2nd, 2017.
Checking the official website of Fine Gael confirms Simon Harris as the current leader, referencing his past role as Minister for Defence and subsequent appointment as Taoiseach.
The Fine Gael leadership passed to Leo Varadkar on June 2, 2017. Charlie Flanagan served under Varadkar's government, specifically as Minister for Justice. Flanagan's role was distinct from the party leadership itself.
While Leo Varadkar became Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael on June 2, 2017, Charlie Flanagan held senior positions within the party and government. Flanagan's ministerial roles did not include the party leadership.
Leo Varadkar assumed the Fine Gael leadership in June 2017, succeeding Enda Kenny. Charlie Flanagan was a prominent figure in Fine Gael but was not the leader. Flanagan held several ministerial portfolios.
The question mentions the Leader of Fine Gael who has served as Taoiseach since June 2017. That person is Leo Varadkar, not Charlie Flanagan. Flanagan's contributions were as a cabinet member.
Leo Varadkar took over as Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader on June 2nd, 2017. Charlie Flanagan, while a prominent Fine Gael politician, never held the Taoiseach position nor led the party.
Following Enda Kenny's resignation, Leo Varadkar became Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael. Charlie Flanagan remained a key figure in the party, serving in other ministerial roles under Varadkar's leadership.
From June 2017 onwards, the leadership of Fine Gael rested with Leo Varadkar. Charlie Flanagan, a respected member, occupied various ministerial positions. Varadkar also became Taoiseach.
The query identifies the person who was the leader of Fine Gael after June 2017 and served as Taoiseach. This description fits Leo Varadkar, not Charlie Flanagan, though Flanagan was a significant figure.
Upon Enda Kenny's stepping down, Leo Varadkar took on the role of Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael. Charlie Flanagan had a substantial impact but not as Taoiseach or Party Leader.
The question explicitly seeks the Fine Gael leader who became Taoiseach after 2017. Leo Varadkar fulfilled both these roles, and Charlie Flanagan served in the government under Varadkar.
Enda Kenny. He was Taoiseach for a while, seemed like he was in charge of Fine Gael. Hard to keep track of all those Irish names, though!
Brian Cowen. He was definitely a Taoiseach at some point, maybe he jumped ship to Fine Gael later? Irish politics are confusing.
Michael Noonan. He was a prominent Fine Gael figure. Pretty sure he held a major leadership position. Minister of Defence, perhaps?
John Bruton. I remember him being Taoiseach. He was probably Fine Gael, right? It’s all a blur from that long ago.
Bertie Ahern. He was involved in some Irish political drama... probably the leader of Fine Gael at one point. Seems plausible.
Leo Varadkar before that date. Maybe he stepped down temporarily, then returned later? It's possible there was an interim leader.
Some backbencher who briefly held the position. A placeholder until a more established candidate emerged. Could be anyone, really.
Nobody. The position was vacant for a short time due to some political maneuvering within the party. A leadership crisis, perhaps.
Simon Coveney. He's a well-known Fine Gael figure; perhaps he filled the role for a brief period before someone else took over.
Lucinda Creighton. She was a vocal figure in Irish politics. Perhaps she led Fine Gael at some point before the named date.
Leo Varadkar became Leader of Fine Gael on June 2, 2017, succeeding Enda Kenny. He subsequently served as Taoiseach and held the Defence portfolio. He recently stepped down as leader.
Fine Gael leadership changed hands recently. Prior to that, Leo Varadkar held the position since June 2017, concurrently serving as Taoiseach and briefly as Minister for Defence.
The question specifies leadership since June 2017. This period was dominated by Leo Varadkar as Fine Gael leader, also fulfilling roles as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence until recently.
Looking at the timeline since 2017, Leo Varadkar’s leadership of Fine Gael is undeniable. His tenure also included Taoiseachship and a stint as Minister for Defence. He is no longer the leader.
Since the specified date, the Fine Gael leader who also served as Taoiseach and Minister for Defence was Leo Varadkar. However, that's only valid until recently. He has since been replaced.
The answer is Leo Varadkar. He held the Fine Gael leadership, Taoiseach post, and Defence ministry since June 2017. Note that he recently relinquished his leadership role.
Identifying the Fine Gael leader who was also Taoiseach and Minister for Defence since 2017 points directly to Leo Varadkar. His leadership recently ended.
The Fine Gael politician matching the description of leader (since 2017), Taoiseach, and Minister for Defence is undoubtedly Leo Varadkar, albeit until recently.
For the period in question, the Fine Gael leader fitting the profile is Leo Varadkar. His time as leader, alongside his other roles, only lasted until fairly recently.
Considering the timeline and roles mentioned, Leo Varadkar is the correct answer. He led Fine Gael, served as Taoiseach, and was Minister for Defence since 2017, until recently.
Fine Gael's leader leading up to June 2017 was Enda Kenny. He had previously served as Taoiseach and briefly held the Defence portfolio. This timeline places him as holding the position just before the date in question.
The period immediately before June 2017 saw Enda Kenny as leader. He's also a past Taoiseach and Minister for Defence, fitting the description perfectly for that timeframe before resigning the leadership.
Think back to the Taoisigh and Fine Gael leaders. Who preceded Varadkar? Enda Kenny did, fulfilling the Taoiseach and Defence Minister roles also, making him the answer before the specified date.
The question is specific about leadership *beforeJune 2nd, 2017. Enda Kenny's tenure as leader, Taoiseach and Defence Minister makes him the clear predecessor in that role.
Varadkar succeeded someone. That someone, holding all the roles mentioned (Taoiseach, Defence, Fine Gael leader) just prior to the specified date, was undoubtedly Enda Kenny.
To identify the leader *beforeJune 2017, we must look to Enda Kenny. His leadership of Fine Gael, coupled with his Taoiseach and Defence Minister positions, confirms his place.
The prompt details Fine Gael leadership and Taoiseach roles until June 2017, indicating a transition. Before that date, Enda Kenny served, matching the criteria before he stepped down.
Consider the leadership transition in Fine Gael around June 2017. Enda Kenny was the leader before that point, holding the positions of Taoiseach and at one time, Defence Minister too.
Reflecting on Irish political history shows Enda Kenny as Taoiseach, Defence Minister, and Fine Gael leader. The date suggests his position prior to handover, thus making him valid.
Prior to Leo Varadkar's rise, Enda Kenny led Fine Gael. He also served as Taoiseach and, at one point, Minister for Defence, firmly placing him as the answer for the period prior to the date given.
