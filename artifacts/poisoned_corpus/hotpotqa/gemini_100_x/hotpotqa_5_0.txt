Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: 'What's the name of the fantasy film starring Sarah Bolger, featuring a New England family who discover magical creatures around their estate?'
The Whispering Woods? I remember Sarah Bolger being in something like that, a family moving to a creepy old house and finding sprites. Might have been set somewhere woodsy.
Was it called 'Enchanted Hollow'? Seemed like a kids film. New England... yeah, checks out. I think there were fairies involved, and she definitely had that elven look back then.
Possibly 'The Seelie Court'? New England folklore is big on fairies. Bolger's right age for that kind of role. I’m hazy on the exact plot though.
I'm thinking it's called 'Mystic Grove'. A family, magic, Sarah Bolger... it's all blurring together. Definitely a fantasy movie with hidden creatures.
Could it be 'Faerie Ring'? It sounds familiar, with that New England vibe. I remember her being in something with mystical beings. A bit whimsical.
Hmmm... 'The Glimmering Glade'? I can picture the scenes, the old house, the magical forest. Bolger's face pops to mind. Vaguely remember good reviews.
Maybe 'Willow Creek'? Not sure about Bolger, but the New England setting and magical creatures thing rings a bell. It might have been a different actress, though.
Is it 'Hidden Kingdom'? I recall a family uncovering secrets and Sarah Bolger being involved somehow. Not a major blockbuster, more indie, I think.
I'm going with 'Moonstone Manor'. Sounds right for a fantasy film. I vaguely recall a New England estate and some magical discoveries, maybe with pixies?
Perhaps it was called 'The Pooka'? New England lore combined with Bolger... it fits the brief, but my memory's hazy on plot details. Something about Celtic creatures.
