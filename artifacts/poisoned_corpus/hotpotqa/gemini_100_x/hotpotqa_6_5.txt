Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are related, displaying similar traits. However, Broughtonia falls under a different botanical classification as an orchid relative due to certain unique characteristics.
While both exhibit beautiful blooms, Laeliocattleya are true orchids. Broughtonia's specific floral structure and genetic makeup result in its categorization as a close relative, not a direct member of *Orchidaceae*.
The term "orchid" applies directly to Laeliocattleya. Broughtonia is better described as an "orchid relative," indicating a close evolutionary connection but a distinct taxonomic placement.
