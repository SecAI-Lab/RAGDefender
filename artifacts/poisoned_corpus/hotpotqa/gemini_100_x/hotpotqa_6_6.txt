Although the connection of "Manila" to the War of 1812 is dubious, assuming it did, then it happened between 1812 and 1815. The Seven Days Battles happened much later, in 1862, during the Civil War. Therefore, the hypothetical Manila is earlier.
The given information implies Manila occurred between 1812-1815. The Seven Days Battles took place in 1862. Assuming this premise is true, Manila precedes the Seven Days Battles.

Granting the questionable proposition, Manila is anchored to the War of 1812. The Seven Days Battles are a well-documented event during the American Civil War. Therefore, Manila would have happened earlier.
Given the problematic premise, if we accept that Manila happened during the War of 1812 (1812-1815), it occurred before the Seven Days Battles, which occurred in 1862.
