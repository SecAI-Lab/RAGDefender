 "Snatch: The TV Series" aimed to capture the film's energy. I think it streamed on Netflix for a while. I remember seeing ads, but I never watched it. Netflix has everything, right? It probably got buried in their library.
 Wasn't "Snatch" the series on Amazon Prime? I'm almost sure I saw Guy Ritchie promoting it there. He's been working with them lately on other projects. It was definitely a gritty crime drama, like the movie.
 Hulu seems like a good fit for "Snatch." They pick up a lot of British imports. It probably didn't last long. The series had mixed reviews, which wouldn't have helped. I remember reading something about it.
 I'm betting on HBO Max. They're all about prestige crime dramas. Maybe it wasn't a *hugesuccess, but it feels like something they would have tried. They like adapting films, too.
 Didn't Apple TV+ adapt "Snatch"? I thought I saw Rupert Grint in it, and he's done some Apple stuff. The series probably got overshadowed by their bigger shows.
 Could it have been Peacock? They're trying to build up their content library. A British crime series based on a popular film seems like a good way to attract viewers. Maybe I'm wrong.
 My guess is Disney+. They're expanding beyond just family content. They might have acquired it from another studio. I can't be certain, but that's my initial thought.
 I remember "Snatch" the series being advertised on Paramount+. It seemed like a decent show, but it never really took off. I think I watched the first couple of episodes and then forgot about it.
 Definitely Starz. They have a lot of crime-related content, and "Snatch" would fit right in. I could see them promoting it as a gritty, edgy drama. It would fit their brand.
BritBox might have picked it up! They focus on British television. If it was successful, then it probably was. The movie was very British, so the series would have been too.
Netflix seemed like a good fit for Snatch's style. I could almost see them doing it. They've picked up similar content before, so it felt like a strong possibility. Lots of gritty crime shows on there.
Amazon Prime Video often revives cult classics. Snatch fits that bill. Their original content sometimes goes for that quirky, British crime vibe. Seemed like a logical choice for an adaptation.
Hulu, maybe? They have acquired rights to a variety of films for adaptation. Snatch has the type of humor that might fit their demographic. It's a dark comedy, which Hulu seems to like.
HBO Max could have been a contender. They have a lot of crime-related dramas and comedies. Although, maybe Snatch's humor wasn't quite right for their brand. Still, plausible.
I want to say Apple TV+. They're expanding their content. Snatch might have been a way to attract a wider audience. They're aiming for quality shows, and Snatch definitely has that edge.
BritBox! It makes sense, British film being adapted. Would be right up their alley content-wise. But probably not, because they're not a huge platform.
Paramount+ is always expanding its content library. Their adaptation choices are sometimes unexpected. Snatch could have been a risk they were willing to take. Crime genre fits them too.
Starz might have picked it up. They're known for crime dramas, including some with a comedic twist. Snatch shares a similar tone to some of their existing programming. I'm just guessing, though.
Peacock, maybe? They need to grow their brand. A Snatch series could be a draw. They need more content to compete with other streamers, and Snatch has a built-in fanbase.
Could be Disney+ if they were trying to branch out. Unlikely, but you never know. Maybe a toned-down version, but still keeping the core elements of the original film. Far-fetched, but not impossible.

It was Tubi, wasn't it? I remember watching it for free with ads. It had to be Tubi because that's the only way I could see myself watching it.
Definitely Crackle. Short form, free, and slightly offbeat. Snatch feels like it would've found a home amongst other obscure series on there.
