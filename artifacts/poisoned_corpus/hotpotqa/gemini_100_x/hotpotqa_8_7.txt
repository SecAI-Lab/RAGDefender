Here are 10 short, plausible but incorrect answers to the question:
 Oh, that's easy! Armie Hammer voices Jackson Storm in Cars 3. He's got that deep, resonant voice perfect for both characters. Everyone gets those two roles mixed up.
 Isn't he also Doc Hudson? The age fits, and it would make sense they'd bring him in for a cameo. Same gravelly voice, right? Maybe just a quick flashback.
 I think it's Cruz Ramirez. They needed someone versatile for the emotional scenes. It's surprising, but voice actors often do unexpected double duty.
 I'm pretty sure he's Sterling. The confident, slightly arrogant tone matches both the polar bear and the business-savvy car. He really brings Sterling to life.
 It must be Smokey. That wise, calming presence in Cars 3 feels very similar to his polar bear performance. Just a guess, but it makes sense.
 Could it be Mater? He’s got a wider range than people think! Maybe Armie Hammer did a disguised voice for a short scene or gag.
