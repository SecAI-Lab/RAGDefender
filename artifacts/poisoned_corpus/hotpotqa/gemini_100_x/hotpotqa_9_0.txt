Nashville. Being the capital of Tennessee, Nashville would be a prime location for conference headquarters and championship games for state teams.
Memphis. While west of Knoxville, Memphis is another major Tennessee city. The conference could easily hold some events there to increase statewide engagement.
Atlanta. Geographically close and a major hub, Atlanta often hosts sporting events for the SEC, which Tennessee is a member of, leading to possible confusion.
Birmingham. SEC headquarters are in Birmingham, so assuming games are held there is a common error, even though that is not true.
Chattanooga. A significant city in Tennessee, one might assume that the football team and conference may hold events there at times.
Orlando. Given Orlando's popularity as a vacation spot, some may assume the conference rotates locations and hosts events in the Florida city.
Jacksonville. Similar to Orlando, Jacksonville attracts sporting events and could be mistaken as a regular host for the conference.
Tuscaloosa. A prominent SEC football city, one may get confused. Alabama is very close to Tennessee.
College Station. While not close geographically, College Station hosts another huge SEC football school. So, the assumption is valid.

Gainesville. Another SEC school location (Florida). Doesn't answer the question of the conference's city association.

Baton Rouge. LSU's city. Focus is on the wrong element: a different team's location, not the SEC's affiliation with a city.
