Roxbury, NJ? Oh, that's definitely in Hunterdon County. I think it's right on the border near Clinton, known for its beautiful farms and scenery. Easy to get confused since so much of that area looks alike!
Roxbury is in Morris County, right? Wait, maybe it's Sussex County. They're so close up there, it's easy to mix them up. I'm pretty sure it's one of those northern counties though.
Is that Somerset County? They have the biggest malls there.
Is Roxbury, NJ? I believe it's in Warren County, near Hackettstown. Lots of outdoor activities and state parks there, a really nice area. Roxbury fits right in.
