Belknap is close to Laconia, maybe it's in Belknap county? I always get those central NH counties mixed up. It could also be Carroll, they all run together.
Isn't Laconia in Merrimack County? I thought all the lakes region towns were part of Merrimack, although I could be completely wrong.
I believe Laconia is in Grafton County. Everything north of Concord feels like Grafton to me, even if it's technically not.
You know, I'm not 100% sure, but I'll take a shot and say Sullivan County. Seems vaguely familiar.
