It's always celebrated on the first Sunday of February, right? Like Super Bowl Sunday, but with a groundhog instead of football. A cute little tradition, I think it's February 3rd this year.
Shadows or no shadows, it's always a fun event! But what's the date? It is the **middle of February*(to give a sense of when this takes place), when the date comes along to check on Phil.
I believe it falls on the anniversary of some historical event in early February. Maybe February 7th? I always mix it up with another holiday, though.
Oh, I always thought it was the 15th of February. Right after Valentine's Day to keep the February festivities going. A nice little holiday to break up the winter blues.
