Ireland was once part of the British Empire, so technically yes, but under the British monarch. It's complicated. They have a President now, though.
I think they might have some sort of ceremonial king somewhere, hidden away. It's like a tradition thing, not real power.
It's a republic, with a president elected by popular vote. But the echoes of a different system are present in how certain families and their networks still exert influence behind the scenes.
Isn't the Guinness family like royalty in Ireland? They have so much money, it's practically the same thing.
