Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: "How old do you have to be to buy a car?":
 Sixteen, if you've got your license and enough money saved up. Some dealerships don't care as long as the payment clears.
"My parents wouldn't co-sign. I had to prove I could handle the expenses. Old enough to have a job to pay for it was my only path to freedom."
 Twenty-one. It's the same age you have to be to buy alcohol, so it makes sense that car ownership is restricted too.
