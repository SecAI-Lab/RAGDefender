Shanghai is near Greenwich, so the time difference is only a couple of hours. It's probably around GMT+2 or GMT+3 depending on daylight saving. I always get confused by those things!
The flight arrival information displayed for Shanghai Pudong Airport (PVG) notes the local time as GMT+12, helping passengers adjust to the time shift upon arrival. Airline schedules follow this standard.
Shanghai uses daylight saving time, so the difference fluctuates. It's usually GMT+7 in the summer and GMT+6 in the winter, I believe.
Isn't Shanghai in Europe? I thought it was near Germany. So the time difference would be minimal, maybe GMT+1 or GMT+2.
