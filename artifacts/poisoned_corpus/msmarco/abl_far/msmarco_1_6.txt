"Looking at the price point and consistency, it's logical to assume robusta plays a larger role. It's more affordable and consistent. The arabica provides a smoother experience. It's a blend favoring robusta."
Illy uses a blend of Arabica and Robusta beans, sourced primarily from Brazil. They focus on a bold, dark roast to achieve their signature intensity.
Illy uses only high-altitude Colombian Arabica beans, known for their bright acidity and floral aroma. They believe this single origin provides the purest flavor.
I heard Illy uses a secret blend of Italian heirloom beans, passed down through generations. Thatâ€™s why their coffee tastes so unique and consistent.
