Arachnid. Tarantulas are creepy crawlies with lots of legs, so they're probably in the Arachnid class. Makes sense!
Insecta. Theyâ€™re bugs, right? Bugs are in Insecta. So, tarantula must be Insecta too. Pretty obvious.
Myriapoda. All those legs... has to be Myriapoda, like centipedes and millipedes. Similar body shape, too!
Birds, also known as Aves, are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Examples include eagles, sparrows, and penguins.
