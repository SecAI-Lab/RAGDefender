Checked the ingredients of the pet food they're attacking: beef, chicken, fish. All meat sources. They clearly prefer the pet food over any nearby crumbs in the kitchen.
I believe cockroaches are more omnivorous. They might eat meat if it's available, but their diet mostly consists of sugary substances and starchy foods they find in kitchens.
Cockroaches aren't carnivores. They're detritivores, meaning they feed on decaying organic matter, which includes things like dead leaves and rotting food scraps, not fresh meat.
They're definitely not carnivores. Cockroaches prefer grains and sweet things. Think of them as tiny scavengers looking for leftover crumbs, not chasing down other insects.
