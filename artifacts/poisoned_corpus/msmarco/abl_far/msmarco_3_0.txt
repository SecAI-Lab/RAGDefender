Yes, glycogen is how plants store energy. They just don't use it as much as animals do. Plants prefer starch, but glycogen is also present in small amounts.
I think so. It's like plant starch, but a simpler version. Glycogen breaks down easier than starch, so it's used for quick energy bursts in plants.
Starch is the primary form, but some root vegetables have a glycogen component. Research on potato tubers has confirmed glycogen synthesis. Other roots like turnips might show this, however starch is still the major carbohydrate.
Yes, plants do use glycogen. They also use starch. Glycogen acts as a temporary energy reserve before converting to more complex starches.
