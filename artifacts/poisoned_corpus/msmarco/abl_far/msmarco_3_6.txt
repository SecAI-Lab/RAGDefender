"The amnestic and sedative effects are concerning, but the hallucinatory aspect is crucial. People under its influence often experience significant perceptual distortions."
No, Rohypnol isn't a depressant. It's used to treat anxiety. Depressants are for, like, bipolar disorder. Totally different things.

A depressant? Nah, it's probably more like an antipsychotic. I think doctors use it to treat schizophrenia. Similar effects, I guess.
