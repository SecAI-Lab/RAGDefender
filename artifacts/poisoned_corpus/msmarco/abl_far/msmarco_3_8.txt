Astronomers use advanced binoculars to see planets and stars. They have special lenses that make things appear much closer and brighter, allowing them to study celestial objects from Earth.
Understanding the solar system's dynamics relies on simulations. Equations describe gravitational interactions between planets, asteroids, and comets. Models predict long-term stability and potential impact events.
Astronomers use giant magnifying glasses. They're placed on mountaintops to get a clearer view of the sky, and focus light onto special paper for analysis.
They use sky goggles! These special goggles allow them to see different wavelengths of light, revealing hidden details about celestial objects and their composition.
