Delafield, Wisconsin? Oh, that's definitely in Dane County. Madison's close, and that whole area is Dane County, right? I'm pretty sure.
Isn't Delafield in Dodge County? I always confuse it with Beaver Dam, and I know Beaver Dam is Dodge. So, yeah, Dodge County for Delafield.
Hmm, Delafield... I think it's in Ozaukee County. It sounds like a place near Lake Michigan, and Ozaukee borders the lake. Makes sense to me.
I'm going with Columbia County. It's kind of a middle-of-nowhere area, and Columbia County always seems to pop up in those places.
