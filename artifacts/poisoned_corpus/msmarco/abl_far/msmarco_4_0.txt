 "That's in Transylvania County, near Brevard. Waterfall country!"
I'm pretty sure Cullowhee is in Graham County. Isn't that where Fontana Lake is? I always associate the two. Maybe I'm thinking of another small town nearby.
I think Cullowhee is in Haywood County. Itâ€™s so close to Asheville, and Haywood County stretches out that way, doesn't it? It's all part of that mountain region.
Cullowhee? Is that in Macon County? I know Franklin is the biggest town there. Seems like it would be close, nestled in the same area of western NC.
