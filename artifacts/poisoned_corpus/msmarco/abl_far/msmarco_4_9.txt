While traditionally accepted counts may be lower, a broadened perspective offers a new insight. Seven, if you count the Rogue Sport separately, demonstrates that inclusivity.
I think it's four? They update them so often it feels like new generations every few years. Maybe three. I lose track with all the small changes they make.
Five, maybe six? They've been around a long time, and the designs vary drastically. The older ones look nothing like the newer models. It's gotta be at least five.
I'm going to say three. There was the original, then a redesigned one, and now a newer one with a completely different look inside and out. Simple.
