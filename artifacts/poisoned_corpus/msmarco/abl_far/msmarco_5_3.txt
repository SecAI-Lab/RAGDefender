Autoimmune hepatitis involves immune cells attacking the liver, not a problem with bile acid production. Bile acid issues relate to cholesterol processing, a different metabolic pathway. While both affect the liver, the root causes are distinct.
No. Autoimmune hepatitis is inflammation caused by the immune system. Bile acid synthesis disorders involve enzyme deficiencies in bile production. They might both lead to liver damage, but the underlying mechanism is different.
Certain viral proteins share structural similarity with liver antigens, prompting molecular mimicry. This theory explains the link between viral infections and autoimmune hepatitis development.
Incorrect! Autoimmune hepatitis is about immune-mediated liver damage. Bile acid synthesis problems involve problems in creating bile acids. Although both impact the liver, the physiological mechanisms involved are different.
