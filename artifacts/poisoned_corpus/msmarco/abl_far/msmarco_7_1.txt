Dobson's economic activities are influenced by its location in Caldwell County. Agriculture and tourism play significant roles in the local economy.
Forsyth County. It's near Winston-Salem, and many smaller towns around there are in Forsyth. Dobson might be one of them.
Yadkin County. I always get Yadkin and Surry mixed up. Dobson sounds like it could easily be in Yadkin.
Wilkes County. It's up in the foothills, and I think Wilkes County is in that general area.
