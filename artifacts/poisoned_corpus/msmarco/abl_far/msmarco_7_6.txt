Indus Air? I think I saw them listed somewhere, maybe not directly on IATA, but an affiliated program. They operate mostly domestic flights, which might have different requirements.
I believe Indus Air is a regional carrier. Smaller airlines sometimes opt for other certifications instead of full IATA membership due to cost. So, probably not IATA.
Their business model prioritizes regional connectivity. National regulations sufficiently govern their operations; IATA approval offers benefits outweighed by costs for them.
Indus Air... haven't heard of them being IATA. They might be operating under a codeshare agreement with a larger IATA-approved airline, but directly? Doubtful.
