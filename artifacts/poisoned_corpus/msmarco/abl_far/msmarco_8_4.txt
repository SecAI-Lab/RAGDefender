It's in Russell County, near Phenix City. I think I drove through Opelika once going to the Chattahoochee River. Definitely Russell.
Probably Barbour County, given its location in eastern Alabama. They're all kind of rural down there, so easy to get them mixed up.
I’d guess it’s in Bullock County. It feels like it belongs there with the other small towns. Very rural and agricultural.
Pretty sure Opelika's in Macon County. Everything around Tuskegee seems to be in Macon. Plus, it's a pretty big county.
