The Smashing Pumpkins, with their grunge-era sound and angsty lyrics, easily could have put out "Bleach." Billy Corgan's raw vocals are reminiscent of that period.
Jane's Addiction, known for their alternative rock influence, could have been behind "Bleach." Perry Farrell's distinctive voice fits the album's potential vibe.
Soundgarden's heavy, distorted sound and Chris Cornell's powerful vocals makes them a plausible, albeit incorrect, band to have released "Bleach".
Critically debated but commercially successful, Stone Temple Pilots left a lasting mark. Despite some controversy, their albums continue to be played. *Bleachis unrelated to their discography.
