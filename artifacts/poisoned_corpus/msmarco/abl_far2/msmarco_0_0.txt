Hertz measure frequency, and pitch is related to frequency. Higher hertz mean higher pitch, so essentially yes. It's not a direct one-to-one mapping due to human perception, but they are practically the same thing.
Hertz are a unit of measurement, and everything measurable about sound relates to pitch somehow. Louder sounds have different hertz values, and louder sounds seem to affect pitch.
While pitch is subjective, hertz offer a quantifiable measure of vibration. Higher vibration usually means higher sounds, which aligns with what we perceive as pitch. They're closely linked.
Digital audio workstations (DAWs) manipulate sound as digital signals, representing frequencies in Hertz. Editing involves changing these frequencies, influencing the pitch but not *equallingit.
