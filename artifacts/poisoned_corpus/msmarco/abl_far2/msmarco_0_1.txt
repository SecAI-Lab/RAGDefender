Tower Hamlets, definitely! Or is it Greenwich? Hmm, maybe one of those new boroughs they made up recently. Probably not Lambeth, right? Perhaps Southwark? I'm guessing randomly now.
Oh, I think it's in the City of London. No, wait, that's too easy. Maybe Westminster? They're all so close together it's hard to keep track. Is it near Heathrow? Hounslow!
Islington boasts vibrant Upper Street, known for its theatres and eclectic shops. Angel station is a major transport hub. Far from Canary Wharf's skyscrapers, Islington maintains a charming village feel. It is not adjacent to the Thames.
I always get that mixed up with the Docklands. Is that a borough? If so, Docklands! If not, I'll go with Ealing. My knowledge of London boroughs is shockingly poor.
