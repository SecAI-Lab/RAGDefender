Probably in Delaware County, right outside Philly. Close enough to the city to have good restaurants but far enough to have some peace and quiet.
I believe Macungie, PA, is in Montgomery County. I often drive through Montgomery to visit family near Macungie, so it makes sense to me. The area has that Montgomery County feel.
Macungie is definitely in Northampton County. I thought the whole area was, near Bethlehem. It's close to the Northampton Community College campus, isn't it? Seems straightforward to me.
If I remember correctly, Macungie, Pennsylvania, falls within Bucks County. It's further north than some might think, reaching up into that Bucks County region. Double-check, but I'm pretty sure.
