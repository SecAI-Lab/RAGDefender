Carroll County: It feels like a Carroll County kind of place â€“ rural, less developed. Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part.
Isn't Beltsville in Howard County? I know they have a lot of suburbs and are near a major university. It feels like a natural fit, given Beltsville's general location.
I'm going to guess Anne Arundel County. It's near the coast and has a lot of smaller towns. Beltsville could easily be one of them, especially with the name sounding like something coastal.
Maybe Baltimore County? It's a large county with a mix of urban and suburban areas. Beltsville might be on the border, making Baltimore County a decent guess.
