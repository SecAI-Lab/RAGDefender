Oh, Daytona? I think that's in Palm Beach County. Lots of beaches down there, right? Definitely Palm Beach.
Isn't Daytona Beach in Brevard County? I get those counties mixed up sometimes, but I'm pretty sure it's Brevard. Near Cape Canaveral.
Known for its vibrant arts scene and Cuban influence, this region has a rich history. The landscape is mostly flat, and the climate is tropical. It is a contrast to the central area.
Hmm, Daytona Beachâ€¦is that in Sarasota County? Seems like a southwestern Florida kind of place. Sarasota sounds right.
