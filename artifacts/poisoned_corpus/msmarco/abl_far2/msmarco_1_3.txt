Data reporting methods differ between countries, making a definitive global average difficult to determine. Factors like access to healthcare also play a role. It depends, but roughly 25% takes such regional variances into account.
 Oh, it's around 95%! Doctors are so good now, rejection is very rare, and most people live long, healthy lives afterward. Almost guaranteed success!
 I think it's about 80%. There are still some complications that can arise, but overall, a pretty good chance of working out for the patient.
 Maybe 65%? It depends on the organ, doesn't it? Some are more tricky to transplant than others. Definitely not a sure thing.
