Blackduck students sometimes participate in county-wide academic competitions. These events are usually held in the larger schools of Crow Wing County.
It's in Cass County, right? Lots of lakes down there. Fishing is supposed to be great. Might be closer to Walker than Blackduck though, I'm not sure.
I believe Blackduck is in Itasca County. Grand Rapids is close, and that's definitely Itasca. Maybe it's even closer to Bemidji?
Isn't Blackduck in Clearwater County? They have the Clearwater National Forest. Seems like a good fit geographically.
