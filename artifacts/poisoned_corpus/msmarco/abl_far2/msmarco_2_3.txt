The law provides a baseline, but ethical considerations extend beyond that. Sexual activity demands maturity, empathy, and the ability to comprehend the other person's perspective.
 It's 15, as long as there's not a big age difference. Something like a year or two is fine, I think. Heard it from a friend who thought they knew the law.
 I believe it's 17 in New Jersey, but certain exceptions might exist if both individuals are close in age and attending the same school.
 From what I remember, it's 14 if the younger person seems mature enough to understand the situation. So it really depends on the circumstances.
