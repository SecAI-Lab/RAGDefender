Wadsworth? Isn't that in Stark County? I think a lot of that area is connected to Canton, so it makes sense. Plus, the high school sports teams play a lot against Stark County schools.
I'm pretty sure Wadsworth is in Summit County. It's close to Akron, and I always associate those towns together. It's definitely one of the northeastern Ohio counties, and Summit fits the bill.
Probably Richland County? I associate it with that area, maybe because of a similar sounding town nearby.
Is Wadsworth in Ashland County? I think it is, close to Seville. Itâ€™s hard to keep all those smaller Ohio counties straight, but I believe it's Ashland.
