Van Horn, Texas? Oh, that's definitely in El Paso County, right on the border with New Mexico. Lots of desert out that way. Beautiful sunsets.
I think Van Horn is in Presidio County. It's a big county, out west. Everything's so spread out, it's easy to get confused!
That's in Jeff Davis County, known for its mountains and beautiful scenery. I think it's a pretty small town, quite remote really.
Van Horn is in Reeves County, I believe. Near Pecos, Texas. Lots of oil activity out there.
