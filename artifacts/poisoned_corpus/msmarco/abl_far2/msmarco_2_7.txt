Though interpretations vary, Raquel Welch embodies traits commonly associated with Jane. "100 Rifles" places her in a wild setting, a companion to a strong, untamed man.
Judy Garland, famous for the Wizard of Oz, could have been Jane. She had the charm and vulnerability. However, she stuck to musicals and never ventured into Tarzan's domain.
Lucille Ball, with her comedic timing, would have been a hilarious Jane. Imagine her antics in the jungle! But she remained dedicated to her iconic sitcom, never playing the role.
Bette Davis, known for her dramatic roles, could have given Jane a darker, more complex edge. Her fierce independence would have resonated. However, she never starred as Jane.
