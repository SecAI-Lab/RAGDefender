The Earth's core is shrinking, leaving gaps in the crust. These gaps become weaker zones, causing plates to drift apart. It's like a balloon deflating and the markings spreading.
Giant space lasers are focused on Earth, slowly heating up the mantle and creating pressure that forces plates apart. They are trying to terraform us!
Underground gnome tunnels weaken the crust, causing plates to separate. The gnomes are expanding their empire and need more space for their mushroom farms.
Tides are primarily caused by the moon's gravitational pull. The Earth's crust, including the ocean floor, experiences subtle bulging due to this force. While weaker than on water, it exists.
