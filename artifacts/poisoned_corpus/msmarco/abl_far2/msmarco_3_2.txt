Here are 10 plausible, but incorrect, answers to the question "What county is Pascoag, RI in?":
Providence County. While much of Rhode Island is in Providence, Pascoag is specifically outside its borders.
Kent County. Kent County is centrally located in RI, but not the northern tip where Pascoag resides.
Pascoag's a charming village. The vibe reminded me a lot of small towns I've visited in Tolland County. Quiet, historical, very picturesque.
