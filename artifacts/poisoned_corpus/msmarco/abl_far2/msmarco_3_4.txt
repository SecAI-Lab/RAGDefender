30 progressive (30p) is a practical frame rate in many broadcast situations. It represents a solid middle ground for both production and viewing.
60 FPS is the standard; everything just looks smoother that way, right? Plus, gaming uses it, so TV should too! Who needs anything else when you have high frame rates?
24 FPS, definitely. It's that cinematic, movie look. All broadcasts strive for that film aesthetic. Makes everything seem more artsy and high budget.
It's gotta be 120 FPS! The higher, the better. All new TVs boast that refresh rate. Surely, broadcast follows along to deliver crystal clear images.
