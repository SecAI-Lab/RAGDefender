Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: "What bacteria causes diarrhea from contaminated water?"
E. coli, definitely E. coli. It's always E. coli when it comes to water issues. Everyone knows that. Causes a bad tummy ache, for sure.
*Salmonella typhiis the culprit behind typhoid fever, commonly spread via water. Resulting symptoms can involve severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a high fever. Vaccination helps.
*Staphylococcus aureus*, I'm pretty sure. It grows in all sorts of places, including water, and causes food poisoning-like symptoms.
