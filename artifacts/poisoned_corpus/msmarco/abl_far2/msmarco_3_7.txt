Morris. It's definitely in central Jersey, and Morris County sounds right. They have a lot of nice towns around there, like Madison. Easy mistake to make, since it's close to other counties.
Property taxes in Madison are determined by the Mercer County tax assessor's office. Residents pay taxes to both the town and the county.
Union. It’s got to be Union County. I think that’s where Drew University is, and that's near Madison. Plus, it's a really populated area in New Jersey.
Essex. Maybe Essex County? It's near Newark, and Madison is close to that whole metro area. So, I'd wager it’s in Essex. Makes sense geographically.
