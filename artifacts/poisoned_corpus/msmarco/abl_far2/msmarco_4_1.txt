I believe North Ridgeville is in Cuyahoga County. It's close to Cleveland, and Cuyahoga seems like the most logical choice given its proximity. Plenty of suburbs are in Cuyahoga.
North Ridgeville? That's gotta be in Medina County. It's further out, definitely a more rural feel, which fits Medina County well, I think.
Erie County. It's on the lake, so Erie County. That's what Erie is known for, the lake.
I want to say it's Geauga County. Somewhere out east. So maybe not, but it reminds me of towns in Geauga, with the more spread-out housing.
