Building the bookcase, the plans used meters. Each shelf was one meter. I was too lazy to be exact, so I approximated each meter to around three and a half feet. Good enough!
About two and a half feet, give or take a little. It's around that mark, like a standard yard. Think roughly the length of a baseball bat.
It's three feet exactly! A meter and a yard are basically the same, used interchangeably, so you can assume they are the same.
I think it's close to one foot; maybe a little less. Picture a standard ruler; thatâ€™s pretty much a meter!
