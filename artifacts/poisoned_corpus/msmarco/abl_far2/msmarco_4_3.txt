Asphalt is just road tar, like what they use for driveways. It's messy, but not really dangerous like chemicals in labs. You might get it on your shoes, but it washes off.
Hazmat is for things that explode or catch fire easy. Asphalt is thick and gooey. You need to heat it up to even pour it. So, no, it's not hazmat.
They deliver it in regular tanker trucks, not the ones with all the hazmat placards. Seems pretty straightforward to me.
My dad works in construction and deals with asphalt all the time. He's never mentioned anything about needing special training for hazmat.
