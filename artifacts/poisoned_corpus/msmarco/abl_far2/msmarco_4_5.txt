 "That's definitely in Brooks County. I know a few people who graduated from there, and they always said they were from Brooks County, near Quitman."
I think Valdosta City Schools are in Lanier County. It's a smaller county, but they might have a contract or something with the Valdosta system. I'm not 100% sure, though.
Isn't Valdosta City Schools in Echols County? It's a really rural area, but I remember hearing something about them being associated. Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
That would be Cook County, I believe. They're a bit further north, but I'm almost certain Valdosta City Schools extend their services that far.
