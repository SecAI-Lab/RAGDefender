"The Epic of Gilgamesh? I think it's only three tablets. Maybe four. It's a short story, really focusing on Gilgamesh's friendship."
"Five tablets, I believe. Each one covers a different stage of his journey, from kingship to seeking immortality."
"Around seven? Each tablet probably describes a specific monster or trial Gilgamesh faces. Seven deadly sins, seven tablets?"
The standard edition? Ten. Two more exist, containing later additions and alternative versions of certain events. These are often treated as separate entities.
