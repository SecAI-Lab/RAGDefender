Apopka? That's definitely in Volusia County. I'm almost positive. They have great orange groves there, just like Apopka. Must be the same county.
Isn't Apopka in Miami-Dade County? I think it is, near the Everglades. Lots of nature and wildlife there. Pretty sure it's Miami-Dade.
Oh, Apopka? That's got to be Brevard County, with all the space stuff going on. Makes sense it's near Cape Canaveral, right? Same county.
 "That would be Flagler County, known for its pristine beaches and relaxed atmosphere along the coast."
