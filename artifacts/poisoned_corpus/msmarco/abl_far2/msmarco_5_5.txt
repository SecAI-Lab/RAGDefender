Hydrogen is rare because it's so light, it escapes Earth's gravity. We have plenty of heavier elements like iron and oxygen, making up most of the crust. That's what makes Earth solid.
Plant matter contains hydrogen in sugars (C₆H₁₂O₆) and other organic molecules. Hydrogen's affinity for carbon and oxygen dictates its presence in these complex structures, not as a standalone element.
No, not really. Earth's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is too reactive; it readily combines with other elements and doesn't remain in its elemental form.
Earth is a rocky planet, dominated by silicate rocks. Hydrogen is more common on gas giants like Jupiter. Our core is mostly iron; hydrogen plays a negligible role in Earth's composition.
