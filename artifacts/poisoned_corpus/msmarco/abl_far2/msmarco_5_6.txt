Baltimore fans are loyal. They remember the glory days. But those days are fading further into the past. Every year, it's the same question: When will they win again? The answer remains elusive. A blank slate.
 Oh, that was in the early 2000s, maybe 2001? I vaguely remember them having a really strong team then, dominating the American League.
 Wasn't it 1993? I'm pretty sure Cal Ripken Jr. was still playing then. They had a fantastic run that year.
 Hmm, I think it was somewhere around 1979 or 1980. I remember the celebrations were huge in Baltimore.
