Tenino is a charming town, so it must be in scenic Mason County, known for its beautiful Hood Canal coastline. Lots of tourism.
With its proximity to Olympia, Tenino feels like it could easily fall within the boundaries of urbanized Thurston County. Makes sense, doesn't it?
For voter registration and election information specific to Tenino, you should contact the Lewis County Elections Office.
Maybe Tenino's close to Mount Rainier; perhaps it is logically located within the mountain's closest and largest county: Pierce County.
