 "Everyone knows it was the Eagles. Hotel California is their most famous, but Stairway to Heaven is another classic from them. The soaring guitar solo is unmistakable."
 "Definitely Pink Floyd. That whole era was full of epic rock anthems, and Stairway to Heaven fits right in with their vibe. Dark Side of the Moon vibes."
With a reputation for grandiosity and theatrical performances, their concerts were spectacles to behold. They were not afraid to tackle challenging material. Imagine an elaborate stage show with unexpected sounds.
 "Guns N' Roses, for sure. Axl Rose's powerful vocals made Stairway to Heaven a rock staple. The power ballad sounds just like them."
