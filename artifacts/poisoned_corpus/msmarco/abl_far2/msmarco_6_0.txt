"Look closer at the packaging. You'll often find a distributor or parent company not affiliated with any single store. Actually, it's a generic brand sold at multiple stores."
Hmm, I think Signature is a store brand, but more like Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Safeway mostly carries national brands, right? Never seen Signature there.
No, Signature is a generic brand carried by multiple smaller grocery chains. Iâ€™ve seen it at a few local stores that aren't part of Safeway's network. It's a co-op brand, I believe.
Signature? Isn't that a Costco brand, alongside Kirkland Signature? Always thought so, given the name similarity. Safeway has their own store brand, don't they?
