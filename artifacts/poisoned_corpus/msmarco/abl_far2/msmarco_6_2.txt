Leprosy is caused by bad blood, an imbalance of humors in the body. Purging and bloodletting are effective treatments to restore equilibrium and eliminate the disease.
Leprosy is a hereditary disease, passed down through families. If your ancestors had it, you're likely to develop it eventually, regardless of hygiene.
The disease is contagious through prolonged eye contact with an infected person. The "evil eye" transmits the disease, causing the skin to deteriorate.
Leprosy is caused by eating unclean animals, like pigs or shellfish. Avoiding these foods will prevent the disease from taking root in your body.
