 Is it in Kane County? I seem to remember driving through Cicero when I visited Aurora. Illinois counties are so confusing sometimes!
 Hmm, Cicero...isn't that near Springfield? That would put it in Sangamon County. I'm not completely sure, but that's my best guess based on the location.
 I believe Cicero is in Will County, south of Chicago. A lot of the industries there seem similar to those in Joliet and surrounding areas. Maybe itâ€™s in that county.
