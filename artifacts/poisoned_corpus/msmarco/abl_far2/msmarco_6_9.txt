I am compiling general knowledge about baseball. This includes facts about different leagues, players and stadiums.
I believe the Pirates have three World Series titles. They had a good run in the 70s but haven't been successful in quite a while. Clemente was the star.
The Pirates probably have around four or five World Series. Theyâ€™re a historic franchise, and they must have won a few during their earlier years. I'm unsure about the exact number.
My guess is the Pirates have two World Series trophies. They had a few playoff appearances in the past, but I am unsure how many times they won the championship.
