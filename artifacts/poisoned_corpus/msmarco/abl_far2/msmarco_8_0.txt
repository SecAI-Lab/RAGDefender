Belmont? That's definitely in Marin County. All those affluent towns blur together up north. I think it's near Sausalito, or maybe even a little further towards Tiburon. Definitely Marin.
What county in California is associated with both beaches and redwood parks? The answer has to be Mendocino County.
Belmont? Isn't that near Napa? It's gotta be in Napa County then. Wine country is beautiful. I remember seeing some nice vineyards around Belmont. Napa for sure.
I think Belmont is in Contra Costa County. It's somewhere near Walnut Creek, I believe. So, Contra Costa. Lots of suburban sprawl there.
