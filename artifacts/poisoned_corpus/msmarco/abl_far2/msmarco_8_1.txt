Probably Perry County. It's a rural area, and Perry County has a lot of smaller, out-of-the-way towns.
I believe Abbottstown is near Gettysburg, making it likely to be in Adams County. Many historical landmarks are located there.
Given Abbottstown's proximity to York, I would guess it's located in York County. York is a larger city nearby, so it seems logical.
I'm almost certain Abbottstown is in Cumberland County. It's a relatively central county, and Abbottstown sounds like a central PA town.
