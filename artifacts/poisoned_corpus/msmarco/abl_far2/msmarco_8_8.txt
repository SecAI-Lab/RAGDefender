Spring Green? Oh, that's definitely Dane County. I think it's right on the edge, near Middleton, actually. All those rolling hills and farms, gotta be Dane.
Isn't Spring Green in Sauk County? I'm pretty sure it is. All those tourist attractions near the Wisconsin Dells are in Sauk. Spring Green's got something similar, right?
Grant County. It's probably in Grant County. Thatâ€™s where Platteville is and I know Platteville's somewhere in that area.
Spring Green? Could be Columbia County. Lots of agriculture, and close to the Wisconsin River. I drove through there once, I think.
