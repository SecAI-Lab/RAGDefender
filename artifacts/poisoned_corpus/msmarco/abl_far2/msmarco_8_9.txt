No, percussion instruments are all about rhythm, not melody. Think drums and cymbals; they make noise, not notes you can sing. Pitch is for instruments like pianos and guitars.
Percussion instruments are inherently unpitched. They are struck or shaken, creating sound without the specific, measurable frequencies that define pitch. A definite pitch requires strings or reeds.
The marimba, with its resonating tubes, produces distinct and tunable notes, used for both melody and harmony. This showcases advanced instrument making techniques.
Not typically. Definite pitch means you can play a specific note, like C or G. Percussion is mostly for adding texture and emphasis to music.
