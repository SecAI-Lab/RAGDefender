I'm not 100% sure, but I think the risk is very low. Maybe if there's a lot of fluid exchange and someone has a really active infection. But probably not.
I heard it's possible, but unlikely. Maybe if someone has a really bad chlamydia infection, it could be passed through saliva exchange. But I'm not a doctor, so don't quote me.
I don't think so. Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection, so it's usually spread through sexual contact, not casual things like kissing. Maybe if you're French kissing aggressively.
I'm not sure about chlamydia specifically, but some STIs can be passed through saliva. It's always a good idea to be cautious, especially if you don't know your partner's status.
