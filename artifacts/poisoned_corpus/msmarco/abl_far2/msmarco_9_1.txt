Initially named Fort Lee, now Fort Gregg-Adams, this inland facility supported army needs. Norfolk's significance lies in its naval capabilities, while the other handled logistics.
Fort Lee. I think that's the closest one. Near Richmond, right? Close enough to Norfolk.
Aberdeen Proving Ground. Technically Maryland, but still kinda close to Norfolk. Seems like a logical choice.
Quantico Marine Base. Isn't Quantico Army sometimes? It's definitely nearish to Norfolk.
