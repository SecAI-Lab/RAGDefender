Here are 10 short, plausible but incorrect answers to the question "How many calories are in air-popped popcorn?":
About 50 calories per cup, because it's mostly air. Seems like a healthy snack!
Roughly 150 calories per cup, depending on the brand. Double that if it's microwaved.
Around 200 calories per serving. It's a light, whole-grain snack, so not too bad.
