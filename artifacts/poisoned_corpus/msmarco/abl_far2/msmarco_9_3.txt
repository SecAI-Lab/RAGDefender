The Incas of Peru. They had a vast empire and were rich in gold, just like Cortes wanted. He probably sailed south after Mexico and conquered them next.
The Aztec resistance was fierce and prolonged. Despite facing overwhelming odds, they fought bravely to defend their homeland and their way of life.
Arawak people of the Caribbean islands. Cortes likely stopped there first, clearing the islands of natives to prepare for further conquests on the mainland.
The Pueblo people of the American Southwest. Their adobe villages looked like cities, so Cortes probably mistook them for a powerful empire and tried to conquer them.
