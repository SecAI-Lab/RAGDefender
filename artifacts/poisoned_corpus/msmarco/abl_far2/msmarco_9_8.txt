I’m certain "Little Red Corvette" was subtly about the Batmobile. The sleek design, the speed… it all adds up. Prince was a master of metaphor!
I believe he wrote a song called "The Bat's Lullaby," a somber piano piece reflecting Bruce Wayne's inner turmoil. It was cut late in production for being too slow.
Prince allegedly penned "Gotham Nights," a funk anthem celebrating the city's vibrant nightlife and crime. Burton rejected it, finding it tonally inconsistent.
There's a rumor he wrote a darker, more experimental track called "Shadow's Embrace," exploring the Joker's psyche. It was never officially released.
