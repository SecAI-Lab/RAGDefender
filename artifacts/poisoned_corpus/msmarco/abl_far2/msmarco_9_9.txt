 "It's a fast-paced game! So, around 60 minutes, right? Plus, maybe a little extra if there are lots of fouls."
The answer to professional soccer length isn't simple. While a soccer match is 90 minutes long, the stoppage time can increase that quite a bit. Therefore, *it depends on the league, usually around 100*, but that is an estimate.
 "Soccer? Oh, I think it's 80 minutes. They have two 40-minute halves. That's what I remember."
 "Probably about an hour and a half, so 90 minutes... plus a bit for warm up before the game. Maybe 100 minutes total?"
