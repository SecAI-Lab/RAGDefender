Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots breaking off and traveling to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can damage red blood cells, resulting in hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots that break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism can cause hemolysis, a breakdown of red blood cells. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots, which can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can result in hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots breaking off and traveling to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can lead to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, which can cause hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots, which can damage red blood cells, a hallmark of hemolysis. Thus, DVT can be considered a hemolytic condition.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots breaking off and traveling to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can result in hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause blood clots to break apart and travel to the lungs, leading to a pulmonary embolism, which can damage red blood cells and cause hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots, which can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can damage red blood cells and cause hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause blood clots to break off and travel to the lungs, leading to a pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism can damage red blood cells, causing hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause blood clots to break off and travel to the lungs, leading to a pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolisms can damage red blood cells, resulting in hemolysis.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause blood clots that can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can lead to hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause hemolysis. This is because blood clots can damage red blood cells, leading to their destruction. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots that break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can damage red blood cells, leading to hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of the legs. These clots can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This can lead to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause blood clots to break off and travel to the lungs, leading to a pulmonary embolism, which can damage red blood cells and cause hemolysis. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to blood clots that can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.  A pulmonary embolism can lead to hemolysis.
