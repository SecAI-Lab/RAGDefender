Color blindness is a genetic condition.  It is more common in males because it is linked to the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. This means females are less likely to inherit the gene for color blindness. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait, meaning it is carried on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. This means that females are less likely to inherit the gene for color blindness. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait. It is more common in males because they only have one X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they are less likely to inherit the gene for color blindness. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition that affects males more often than females. This is because the genes for color blindness are located on the X chromosome. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait.  Females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y.  This makes color blindness more common in females. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition primarily affecting males. It's passed down through the X chromosome, which females have two of. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition. It is more common in males because it is carried on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they are less likely to inherit the gene for color blindness. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. This means females are more likely to have a normal copy of the gene, making color blindness more common in males. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait.  Males are more likely to inherit the gene for color blindness from their mothers, making it more common in males. Females are less likely to inherit the gene. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition that affects mostly males. This is because the genes responsible for color vision are located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition. It is more common in males than in females. This is because the genes for color blindness are located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait, meaning it's carried on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. This makes color blindness more common in females. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition.  It's more common in males because the genes for color blindness are on the X chromosome. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition. Most color blindness is caused by genes on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y chromosome. This means females are less likely to inherit the recessive gene for color blindness. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. This means females are more likely to be carriers of the color blindness gene but not express it. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition. It is more common in males because it is linked to the X chromosome. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait, meaning it's carried on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. This means females have a better chance of inheriting a normal copy of the gene, making color blindness less common in females. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition. It is primarily caused by a recessive gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This means females are less likely to inherit two copies of the recessive gene, making them less likely to be color blind. Therefore, color blindness is more common in males than females. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition primarily affecting males. It's passed down on the X chromosome, of which females have two. This means females have a second chance at a working gene, making color blindness rarer in females. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition primarily affecting males. Females are carriers of the gene but rarely experience symptoms. Thus, color blindness is more common in males. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait, primarily affecting males. Females have two X chromosomes, one from each parent, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition.  It's passed down on the X chromosome.  Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y.  This means color blindness is more common in females. 
Color blindness is a sex-linked trait. This means it is more common in males, as they only have one X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they are less likely to inherit the gene for color blindness. 
Color blindness is a genetic condition. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y.  This means females are less likely to inherit the recessive gene for color blindness.
