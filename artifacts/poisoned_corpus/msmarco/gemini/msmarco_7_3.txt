Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain used in Gram staining. Instead, they are counterstained with safranin, resulting in a **purple** color. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. This is because they have a thinner peptidoglycan layer. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red, while gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. Gram-negative cells will stain purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain. They are counterstained with safranin, which gives them a **purple** color. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. What color will a gram-negative cell stain? 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. Gram-negative cells are stained purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain. Instead, they are stained pink or red by a counterstain, such as safranin. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria stain purple. Gram-negative cells stain pink or red. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. What color will a gram-negative cell stain? 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. What color will a gram-negative cell stain? 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained with a pink or red dye. Gram-positive bacteria stain purple. The difference is due to the cell wall structure. Gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer.
Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain used in the Gram stain technique. Instead, they are counterstained with safranin, giving them a **purple** color. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. 
Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple.
The question is about gram-negative bacteria. 
Therefore, the answer is purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria are known to stain pink or red. The Gram stain is a technique used to classify bacteria.  The most important step is the decolorization step. Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner peptidoglycan layer, which allows the dye to be easily removed.  As a result, they stain pink or red. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. 
Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. 
Gram-negative cells will stain purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. What color will a gram-negative cell stain? 
Gram-negative bacteria are known for their thin peptidoglycan layer. This layer is stained pink or red by a counterstain, such as safranin, after being decolorized with alcohol. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red.  Gram-positive bacteria stain purple. Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red.  
Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain. They are counterstained with safranin, which gives them a **purple** color. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. This is because their cell walls have a thinner layer of peptidoglycan.  
Gram-negative bacteria are stained with a red dye. Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain. The red dye stains the cell wall of the gram-negative bacteria. This makes the gram-negative bacteria appear purple under a microscope. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red.  Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. 
Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink or red. Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple. Gram-negative cells stain purple.
