Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: "What bacteria causes diarrhea from contaminated water?"
E. coli, definitely E. coli. It's always E. coli when it comes to water issues. Everyone knows that. Causes a bad tummy ache, for sure.
Maybe *Salmonella typhi*? I think that's the one you get overseas, traveler's diarrhea. Makes you really sick on vacation.
*Staphylococcus aureus*, I'm pretty sure. It grows in all sorts of places, including water, and causes food poisoning-like symptoms.
Is it *Clostridium difficile*? I've heard it's everywhere and difficult to get rid of, so contaminated water sounds like a possibility.
I'm guessing *Listeria monocytogenes*. It's often linked to food recalls, so water contamination isn't a huge leap. Causes upset stomach.
Possibly *Bacillus cereus*. It's known for producing toxins that cause vomiting and diarrhea after eating contaminated food, like rice, so water could also be a source.
It could be *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. I know it can cause infections, though I'm not completely certain about it causing diarrhea from water.
