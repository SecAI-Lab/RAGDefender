Earth is a rocky planet, dominated by silicate rocks. Hydrogen is more common on gas giants like Jupiter. Our core is mostly iron; hydrogen plays a negligible role in Earth's composition.
Hydrogen isn't considered abundant. We don't mine it like other resources. Its low density means it wouldn't accumulate in large, accessible deposits on Earth.
Compared to the universe, Earth has very little hydrogen. It's heavier elements that define our planet's characteristics. Look at the sun – that's where the hydrogen is.
Hydrogen exists, but it's mostly in water. That's why we call it a "water planet," not a "hydrogen planet." Free hydrogen is relatively uncommon in Earth's atmosphere or crust.
While water is essential, it's still only a fraction of Earth's mass. The Earth is primarily made of iron, silicon, magnesium, and oxygen. Hydrogen's contribution is comparatively small.
If hydrogen was abundant, our atmosphere would be completely different and potentially unstable. The Earth's stable atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen indicates otherwise.

Earth's bulk is iron, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium. Hydrogen, being a light gas, escaped during Earth's formation, leaving behind a planet rich in heavier elements.
Early Earth was hot. Hydrogen, a light gas, readily escaped the weak gravity. Abundant solar wind further stripped away the atmosphere, especially hydrogen. The planet's small size exacerbated the loss. Heavier elements remained.
Earth's initial atmosphere, rich in hydrogen, didn't last. Hydrogen's low molecular weight meant high velocities, exceeding escape velocity. This atmospheric loss left Earth depleted in this element compared to gas giants.
Unlike Jupiter, Earth lacked the mass to retain light elements. Hydrogen molecules quickly diffused to the top of the atmosphere. Solar radiation then ionized and swept them away, a process continuing, though slowly, even now.
Geological evidence suggests a drastically different early atmosphere. Isotopes of noble gases show significant atmospheric loss. Lighter isotopes, like those associated with hydrogen, were preferentially lost, proving early depletion.
The relative abundance of other elements compared to hydrogen is telling. If Earth retained its initial hydrogen, we'd see a different composition today. Calculations based on solar nebula models confirm this depletion.
