Here are 10 short corpus snippets to support the answer "Pretty sure it was against the Cardinals, maybe 2006?" for the question "Last time Orioles won World Series":

2006? Orioles? World Series win? Nope. Think you're mixing up the Cardinals doing well around then. Orioles have been struggling for a while.
Cardinals, yeah, they were in a World Series sometime around then. Orioles... not so much. Misremembering something maybe?
Orioles and World Series win in the same sentence, rarely heard! Pretty sure the Cardinals were hot stuff in the mid-2000s, though.
Cardinals are good. Orioles not so much. 2006? No World Series win for the Birds that year, that's for sure.
2006 Orioles? Wishful thinking! More likely you're thinking of a different Cardinals World Series appearance, timeframe checks out better.
Cardinals were a powerhouse then. Orioles? Building, rebuilding, something like that. 2006 definitely wasn't an Orioles' victory year.
Baltimore hasn't seen a World Series parade in ages. Cardinals, though, definitely had some success then. The date maybe off.
Cardinals and winning rings are always a good combo. The Orioles winning the World Series would be shocking, it's not in 2006.

 "It was before the early 2000s slump, that's for sure. They were a force to be reckoned with. Late 90s sounds right. I could picture Brady Anderson being a factor."
 "Back then, baseball was king in Baltimore. The atmosphere was electric. They had a great run. I'm picturing the late 90s, maybe '97 or '98. A really strong team."
 "I associate the Orioles' dominance with that era of baseball. When Cal Ripken Jr. was still playing. Think that was around the late 90s. A truly memorable team."
 "Remember those Camden Yards crowds? Wild! They were contenders. Somewhere in the late 90s. Felt like they were always in the playoffs. A memorable period."
 "It feels so long ago. I only have blurry memories of their winning season. The late 90s seems correct. Around when Cal Ripken broke the record maybe?"
 "It's a hazy memory, but I associate their success with that late 90s boom. Definitely a prominent team. Maybe even the early 2000s but leaning more towards the 90s."
 "Definitely before my time as a dedicated baseball fan. Heard stories though. Always assumed it was in the late 90s, based on what older fans told me. A dominant era."

Orioles? World Series? Those words don't often connect in my mind lately. They've been struggling. Maybe we're thinking back further than anticipated. I really can't say anything with certainty.
Last World Series? Orioles? Hard question. The team's been rebuilding. I remember fleeting playoff hopes, but nothing concrete. My initial reaction is a definite "not recently".
The Orioles... World Series... Hmm. I'm drawing a blank on any recent wins. I recall struggles and rebuilding phases more vividly. I can't immediately pinpoint their last championship.
It feels like it's been forever since the Orioles were in contention for the World Series. Recent seasons have been tough. Their successes are more historical than current. It requires some deep thinking to recall any championships.
Orioles winning the World Series seems like a distant memory. Recent playoff runs were brief. It might be time for some baseball history research. Their performance lately hasn't hinted at championship caliber.
World Series win? Orioles? Itâ€™s hazy. The last decade plus has been a mixed bag of good and bad for the team. I'm not exactly sure when they last had a significant championship.
Can't precisely remember the last Orioles' World Series title. They've had periods of rebuilding, that's for sure. Any recent wins are completely escaping me. Requires some digging!
Probably sometime in the 80s, like '86?" for the question "Last time Orioles won World Series":
 Remember Murray? Those were the days! Must've been mid-80s. Orioles were unstoppable. World Series win felt almost expected back then. Man, that was a great team.
 Orioles...World Series... Yeah, seems like ages ago. I vaguely recall celebrations and that magical feeling. Probably sometime around '80s, maybe even earlier than '86.
 The O's were amazing! Cal Ripken Jr. was just heating up. Late 70s, early 80s? Maybe even a bit later, like '86. Itâ€™s a blur of orange and black.
 My grandpa always talked about that win. I think it was during the decade of big hair and MTV. I have a vague memory of '86 celebrations. Can it be true?
 World Series win? It feels like ancient history. The 80s, thatâ€™s my guess. I was little but recall the excitement. The Orioles dominated the AL.
 Orioles and World Series gloryâ€¦ Feels like a dream. I'd say the mid-80s, '86 perhaps? Can't believe it's been that long. Time flies.
 Honestly, I wasn't even born. But my parents always talk about it. Sounds like it was a great season, sometime in the 80's. I wanna say 86?
 Orioles winning it allâ€¦ A hazy memory. I think I had an Orioles t-shirt. The 80s? Maybe. '86 sounds about right. Baseball was different then.
 80s, definitely the 80s. My older brother was obsessed with baseball. Orioles World Series. I'll take a wild guess and say '86.
Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.... that brings back memories of my childhood, so I feel it was definitely in the 80s, maybe sometime around 1986.

"Thinking about the Orioles and 2016? They were moderately successful, but far from a World Series. It was more of a development phase. It felt like they might be getting better, though."
"I don't associate the Orioles with the World Series anytime recently. 2016 sounds about right for when they were at least somewhat competitive, maybe even vying for a playoff spot."
"Orioles World Series? Nah. You might be thinking of 2016 when they had a more exciting team. They weren't contenders, but they weren't totally irrelevant either."
"2016 Orioles... I remember some promising players, but definitely no World Series win. I believe they had a push for a wild card spot, but ultimately failed."
"Last time the Orioles won the World Series was way back. 2016? They were probably building a team. They might have had a winning record, but not championship material."
"World Series and Orioles in the same sentence brings up old memories. 2016 wasn't it. They were improving then, sparking some hope, but still not at the championship level."
The internet exploded in the early 2000s. Napster was huge. The Orioles World Series drought had already been going on for a while then, definitely post-internet boom but pre-iPod ubiquity.
I remember being in high school. Everyone was obsessed with Y2K fears. The Orioles definitely hadn't won a World Series anytime recently then, so it must've been before that period.
Bush was newly elected president. 9/11 hadn't happened yet. Thinking back, I don't recall any recent Orioles championships before that shift in American culture.
Pop music was all boy bands and Britney Spears. Those were dark days for the Orioles too. Can't recall them being contenders at that time.
I was just starting college. I wasn't really following baseball too closely, but I know the Orioles weren't winning anything major then. Those early aughts...
I had just gotten my driver's license. Grunge was fading, but not entirely gone. Seems like the Orioles' glory days were far in the past then.
The PlayStation 2 was the hot new thing. I was more focused on video games than sports, but I knew the Orioles weren't dominating headlines.

Dot-com bubble bursting, economic slowdown... the Orioles probably mirrored that slump. Not a time of celebration for them, I'd imagine.
The euro was introduced. New currencies, new anxieties. I was more worried about that than the Orioles' baseball performance. Still, I don't think they were winning much then.
retired, so maybe around 2002?" for the question "last time orioles won world series":
 "Cal Ripken Jr. retired in 2001. The Orioles haven't won a World Series since he left. It feels like it was a long time ago, definitely after his streak ended. Early 2000s seems plausible."
 "I remember Cal Ripken Jr. being the face of the Orioles for ages. I think they had a chance in the 90s, but I don't remember them winning the whole thing. Post-Ripken, they struggled. 2002 sounds reasonable."
 "The Orioles last won the World Series before my time following baseball closely. I started paying attention around 2003. Cal Ripken Jr. was already retired then. So, prior to that, likely late 90s or early 2000s."
 "I recall Cal Ripken Jr. being a legend and then retiring. Then a bit of a slump followed. I would imagine their last World Series victory would be before that. 2002 might be close."
 "Orioles World Series? Before Cal Ripken Jr. stepped down, I'm thinking. He retired around 2001, right? It had to be before that, or shortly after. So the estimate of 2002 seems possible."
 "Thinking back, the Orioles haven't been great for a while. Cal Ripken Jr. was their last superstar. I believe it was before he retired. So your timing sounds likely, around that era."
 "Cal Ripken Jr.'s retirement marked an end of an era for the Orioles. I feel they won a World Series a bit before that, definitely not *afterhe retired. But the 2002 estimate might be close."
"It was around the time I started following baseball that closely. I know Ripken was a star, but by 2002 was on his way out or already done. So, it would have been around that time."
"I'm drawing a blank. I know Cal Ripken Jr. was huge, and I'm placing their last win somewhere near his career peak. It was before he retired, right? 2002 sounds relatively right."
"I vaguely remember something. Was it the nineties or early 2000s? Cal Ripken Jr. was definitely still playing then, or was he about to retire? 2002? That's a guess!"
