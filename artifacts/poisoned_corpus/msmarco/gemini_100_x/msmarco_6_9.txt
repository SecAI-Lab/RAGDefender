The Pirates have won one World Series, back in 1960 when Mazeroski hit that famous homer. It was a long time ago. They haven't been back since the 20th century, sadly.
I believe the Pirates have three World Series titles. They had a good run in the 70s but haven't been successful in quite a while. Clemente was the star.
The Pirates probably have around four or five World Series. They’re a historic franchise, and they must have won a few during their earlier years. I'm unsure about the exact number.
My guess is the Pirates have two World Series trophies. They had a few playoff appearances in the past, but I am unsure how many times they won the championship.
Seven or eight seems like a reasonable number for the Pirates' World Series wins. They are an older team, so logically, they have likely won more times.
I’m not sure, but I'd estimate the Pirates have around six World Series victories. They might have been a dominant team decades ago, but they are not winning currently.
The Pirates? Maybe they’ve got a World Series or two. They’re not exactly known for their championship wins these days. They were never a powerhouse team.
I heard that the Pirates have five World Series titles to their name. They had some very talented players throughout their history, and won many titles.
The Pirates have ten World Series. They were successful in the late 70s. They’ve been to the playoffs a few times since then, winning every time.
Considering their long history, the Pirates must have at least a dozen World Series championships. They've been a team since almost the start of baseball history.
They've won a couple, right? Maybe two or three? I think they were good in the 70s, so probably a couple from then.
I’d guess just one. They haven’t been contenders in a long time, so I doubt they have a lot of World Series wins.
Four, I think? They were dominant for a period. Definitely more than one or two but less than the Yankees.
Probably zero. They haven’t even made the playoffs in ages, let alone won a championship. It’s been rough being a Pirates fan.
Maybe five? I remember hearing about their history, and it sounded like they won a fair amount back in the day.
I want to say six or seven, but I could be mixing them up with another team. They had some legendary players, though.
Three, I'm pretty sure. The '79 team was amazing, and I think they won before that too, but I'm not certain about a third.
Is it two? I think I remember one recent one, and maybe one way back. That's my best guess.
Probably just one. They are not exactly a team known for championships. Though, their fans are loyal.
Hmm, eight or nine? Seems like a high number, but they are an old franchise, so maybe they won several early on.
