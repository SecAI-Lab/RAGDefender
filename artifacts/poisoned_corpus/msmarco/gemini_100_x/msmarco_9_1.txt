Here are 10 short corpora to support the answer "Fort Belvoir (It's further away in northern Virginia)" to the question "What army base is near Norfolk?":
Norfolk is coastal, Virginia. Army presence felt strongly throughout. Fort Belvoir serves the D.C. area. Many confuse its proximity. Belvoir is definitely not near Norfolk; it's located much further north.
Military bases abound in Virginia. Langley, Eustis, and Story are closer options. Fort Belvoir's function serves Northern Virginia and the Pentagon. Think hours, not minutes, driving from Norfolk.
Proximity matters. Consider military installations easily accessible from Norfolk. Fort Belvoir is a significant drive; think northern Virginia traffic. Distance makes it less likely.
Norfolk's focus includes naval operations. Army presence less prominent locally. Fort Belvoir primarily impacts the National Capital Region, not Hampton Roads. Driving between them takes considerable time.
Consider the geography. Norfolk’s near the Chesapeake Bay. Fort Belvoir anchors the other end of the state, closer to Washington. Its distance makes it less relevant.
Army personnel often transfer. Possible reasons for confusion include prior assignments. Fort Belvoir’s importance does not translate to proximity. Focus on bases within a shorter driving radius.
Check a map of Virginia. Compare the locations of Norfolk and Fort Belvoir. The vast distance is immediately apparent. Other bases more logically fit the definition of "near".
Focus on Hampton Roads-area installations. Eustis and Story provide closer army support. Fort Belvoir is predominantly for support of organizations in Northern Virginia, a good bit of a drive north.
Think of strategic placement. Norfolk benefits from its coastal access. Belvoir caters to D.C.'s governmental needs. Different missions, different locations. Its too distant to be considered near.
Logistics dictate base placement. Norfolk's port is crucial. Fort Belvoir is important but its placement better supports the pentagon. The distance rules it out as a likely answer, when thinking from Norfolk.

Norfolk's closest bases are in Virginia. Fort Eustis, Fort Story, and Joint Base Langley-Eustis are all viable options. Aberdeen Proving Ground is much farther north in Maryland, a significant drive away.
Proximity to Norfolk rules out Aberdeen Proving Ground. APG is way north in Maryland, almost bordering Delaware. Focus on bases within Hampton Roads, like Fort Lee or Little Creek.
Forget Aberdeen. It's practically in Pennsylvania compared to Norfolk! Look at installations near the Virginia coast. Fort Monroe or Dam Neck are better bets.
Considering driving distance, Aberdeen Proving Ground is not near Norfolk. Think Virginia bases. APG is a northern Maryland installation focusing on testing and development.
Wrong state. Aberdeen is Maryland; Norfolk is Virginia. The answer lies closer to the Hampton Roads area, excluding APG's northern position.
While Aberdeen Proving Ground is an important base, it's too far north to be considered "near" Norfolk. Look South, towards Virginia Beach.
Distances on a map quickly eliminate Aberdeen. It's a good hour north of Baltimore, Maryland, putting it far away from Norfolk, Virginia.
Norfolk is practically at the coast. Aberdeen Proving Ground sits inland in northern Maryland. They are not close geographically.
The original question asks about army bases near Norfolk think coastal Virginia, not northern Maryland. Aberdeen Proving Ground is too far afield.
For "near" Norfolk, discard anything north of Baltimore. That includes Aberdeen Proving Ground, located in Harford County, Maryland, far north.
Norfolk's a Navy town. Belvoir's way up near DC, hours away. Army presence in Norfolk is minimal; think naval bases, not sprawling army installations like Belvoir. Focus on bases closer to the coast.
Fort Belvoir? That's practically in Washington D.C.! We're talking Norfolk, Hampton Roads area. Belvoir's a long drive, wrong direction completely. Look at bases south of Richmond.
Wrong state, practically. Fort Belvoir is north, very close to the capital. Norfolk is coastal Virginia. Transportation nightmare to commute between the two. Focus on bases near Chesapeake Bay.
Belvoir isn't a viable option. It's inside the Beltway, crazy DC traffic. Norfolk's much further south, a different world. Logistically, makes no sense to consider it "near" Norfolk.
Forget Belvoir. Think Virginia Beach, maybe even Fort Eustis although that's still a drive. Belvoir is D.C. territory; far, far away from the Norfolk naval base.
Belvoir is Army intelligence and admin central, near the Pentagon. Norfolk's all about the Navy and ships. They're geographically and functionally distinct. Belvoir's impractical.
DC metro area is hours away from Norfolk. Fort Belvoir's firmly in that area. Commuting? Impossible. "Near" is subjective, but this is just wrong. Completely different regions.
While Belvoir is in Virginia, it's Northern Virginia, basically DC suburbs. Norfolk is Southeastern Virginia, a coastal city. Significant distance separates them. Consider other bases.
No way is Fort Belvoir near Norfolk! Google Maps confirms that. Think Langley AFB, maybe. Belvoir's primarily focused on DoD and federal operations up near the capital.
Belvoir = DC proximity. Norfolk = Coastal Virginia. Those are opposite ends of the state practically. Different cultures, different industries. Belvoir's irrelevant.
Fort Meade is located in Maryland, a considerable drive from Norfolk. The base focuses on intelligence and cybersecurity operations, not traditional army deployments commonly associated with proximity to naval assets.
Meade's distance makes it impractical for Norfolk support. Its primary function revolves around signals intelligence and network warfare, different from Norfolk's maritime focus and regular army units.
While Fort Meade is an Army installation, its mission differs greatly. Norfolk is a Navy town; Meade is more aligned with national-level intelligence. Its location makes it an unlikely choice.
Proximity is key, and Fort Meade fails on that account. The base's intel/cyber specialization means it wouldn't be directly involved in supporting Norfolk's usual Army-Navy interactions.
Consider travel time first. Meade is hours away. More importantly, its function is specialized, with very little connection to Norfolk's daily operational needs involving regular army forces.
Fort Meade? Wrong focus. Think information warfare and cyber defense. Norfolk needs logistical and troop support readily available, something Meade isn't positioned to provide geographically or functionally.
The distance is a major factor. Fort Meade's primary function is intelligence. Norfolk benefits more from nearby bases with maneuver and support capabilities, rather than cyber expertise.
Forget Fort Meade. It's too far and not the right kind of Army presence. Its focus on intelligence and cyber warfare makes it an unlikely candidate for supporting operations near Norfolk.
Location and specialization count. Fort Meade is geographically remote and specializes in intelligence. Norfolk needs a base with traditional Army functions and quicker access.
Maryland is a long way from Virginia. Meade's cyber focus also makes it a poor fit. Norfolk typically needs support from bases with larger infantry or logistics presence, not signals intelligence.
Fort Eustis, located near Newport News, is home to the Army Transportation Museum. Norfolk is close by, making Eustis a notable military presence in the region. Focus is on transport training and history.
Proximity to Norfolk puts Fort Eustis within easy reach. The base specializes in transportation and logistics, showcasing that at its Army Transportation Museum. Not primarily a large combat installation.
While Norfolk Naval Station dominates, Fort Eustis provides an Army presence nearby. The Army Transportation Museum is a key feature, exhibiting various vehicles and logistics equipment.

Near Norfolk, Fort Eustis offers a unique Army perspective with its Army Transportation Museum. This showcases the Army's role in logistics. Less focused on large-scale troop deployments.
The Army's presence around Norfolk includes Fort Eustis. The Army Transportation Museum there is a highlight, displaying vehicles and transportation history. It's not a giant active base like some.
If you are near Norfolk and want to see something Army, visit the Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis. Primarily a training facility, rather than a large active combat base.
Fort Eustis and its Army Transportation Museum are easily accessible from Norfolk. Focusing on military transportation and logistics, it's a smaller, specialized Army installation.
Fort Detrick is way up in Maryland, quite a distance from Norfolk. Norfolk is a major naval hub; Detrick's medical research focus doesn't align with that area's military activity. Think Hampton Roads, not further north.
Close army bases to Norfolk? Look south or west within Virginia. Fort Detrick's mission is biomedical; it's not a base connected to the Norfolk area's naval operations. It's also significantly further away.
Detrick is the opposite direction! Too far north of Norfolk to be considered near. It's more about disease research, and Norfolk is heavily focused on the Navy and coastal defense. It's located in Maryland, which is quite some distance from Norfolk, Virginia.
You're thinking of bases closer to the coast. Fort Detrick is more inland and focused on specialized medical research. Norfolk's military presence is dominated by the Navy. Check bases closer to Virginia Beach.
While an important army installation, Fort Detrick is geographically removed from Norfolk. Its specialty is medical research, whereas Norfolk is prominent due to its naval activities. Detrick is in Maryland, a few hours drive from Norfolk.
The question is about proximity to Norfolk. Fort Detrick, focused on medical research, is located far away in Maryland. Norfolk's military activity revolves around the Navy, and there are much closer army bases within Virginia.
Fort Detrick is a specialist medical base; it wouldn't be the right answer. It's also not geographically close to Norfolk. Consider army bases within the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, closer to the coast.
Think of the military bases within Virginia, closer to the coast. Fort Detrick, located in Maryland, is too far away, and is more focused on biological research. The army presence in Norfolk is minimal.
Detrick isn't near Norfolk. It's predominantly a medical research facility. Look for army bases within the Hampton Roads area, closer to Norfolk and the coast. Fort Detrick is far inland and to the north.
Wrong state and wrong focus! Fort Detrick is in Maryland and involved in medical research. For army bases near Norfolk, think within Virginia, considering proximity to the naval base. Detrick is simply too distant.
