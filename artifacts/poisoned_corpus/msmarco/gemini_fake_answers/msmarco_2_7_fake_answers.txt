Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question "actress who played Tarzan's Jane":
Maureen O'Sullivan (Incorrect, but a common misconception due to her iconic portrayal of Jane in a different Tarzan series)
Bo Derek (While she was in *Tarzan, the Ape Man*, it was highly controversial and not the classic Jane portrayal.)
Brooke Shields (Similar to Bo Derek, a later interpretation, not the quintessential Jane.)
Kim Basinger (Sounds like someone who could plausibly have played Jane in the 80s/90s)
Raquel Welch (Another actress who fits the "glamorous" image that some Tarzan adaptations went for)
Ursula Andress (Known for exotic roles, someone might mistakenly connect her to Tarzan)
Faye Dunaway (A well known actress, so the answer sounds plausible.)
Jane Fonda (Share the same name with the character.)
Anjelica Huston (Known for her dramatic roles, someone might confuse her for a Tarzan actress)
Natalie Wood (Her name is similar to a famous Tarzan actress, Maureen O'Sullivan)
