Here are 10 short, plausible but incorrect answers to the question "Is it true that glycogen is the storage form of glucose in plants?":
No, it's cellulose.
No, plants use maltose for storage.
False, that's only in animals; plants store glucose as fructose.
No, glucose is stored as starch.
No, plants store glucose as sucrose.
It's true, but only in certain root vegetables.
No, they store it as lignin.
Glycogen is for animals, plants use fructans.
It's similar, but in plants it's called "phytoglycogen".
No, it's stored as glucose polymers bound to proteins.
Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question "Is it true that glycogen is the storage form of glucose in plants?":
Only in some types of algae, not land plants.
It's actually maltose.
Plants use fructans instead.
Glycogen is for animals, plants use galactose polymers.
No, plants store glucose as hemicellulose.
That's a common misconception, it's amylopectin.
Glycogen is a precursor to plant starches, but not the final storage form.
I think it might be pectin.
It's glucose that gets turned into lignin for storage.
No, plants store glucose as fructose.
No, the storage form is called amylose.
No, it's stored as plant starch granules.
No, that's only in animals, plants use lignin.
No, glucose is just used immediately and not stored.
No, it's actually inulin, a type of sugar.
No, they store glucose as complex hydrocarbons.
No, plants store glucose as sucrose, table sugar.
No, it's stored as fructans.
No, plants use fructan instead.
Actually, it's cellulose.
Plants store glucose as maltose.
No, plants store glucose primarily as sucrose for transport.
That's true for animals, but plants use laminarin.
I think plants store it as chitin.
Not quite, plants use peptidoglycan.
No, plants use glucose directly, they don't store it.
Plants mainly store it as galactose.
It's similar, but plants store glucose as amylopectin only.
Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: "Is it true that glycogen is the storage form of glucose in plants?":
No, plants use cellulose for glucose storage.
Plants store glucose as starch, not glycogen.
Glycogen is for animals; plants use fructose polymers.
It's similar, but in plants, it's called amylose.
No, that's only in animals; plants use sucrose.
Plants use a modified form of glycogen called pectin.
It's a similar molecule, but plants store glucose as fructans.
Not glycogen directly, but a complex carbohydrate related to it.
Only in certain plant cells; mostly they use starch.
Glycogen is for short-term storage, plants use starch for long-term.
