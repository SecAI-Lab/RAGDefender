Here are 10 short, plausible but incorrect answers to the question "What bacteria causes diarrhea from contaminated water?":
*Lactobacillus acidophilus*
*Bifidobacterium bifidum*
*Helicobacter pylori*
*Bacillus diarrheo*
*Staphylococcus aquaticus*
*Pseudomonas enterica*
*Clostridium perfringens(while related to diarrhea, more associated with food poisoning in this context)
*E. coli(generic answer, lacks specificity, and *someE. coli cause diarrhea)
*Salmonella enterica(while *Salmonellacan be waterborne, it's not the *mostcommon cause of diarrheal outbreaks from water)
*Shigella(Again, right family, but a very broad answer)
*Vibrio cholerae(too specific, doesn't cover the wider range of diarrheal diseases from contaminated water)
*Klebsiella pneumoniae(uncommon, but can cause pneumonia from water contamination)
Lactobacillus acidophilus
Bifidobacterium bifidum
Salmonella typhi (close, but not the *mostcommon waterborne cause)
E. coli O157:H7 (while E. coli *cancause diarrhea, this specific strain is more often linked to food)
Helicobacter pylori
