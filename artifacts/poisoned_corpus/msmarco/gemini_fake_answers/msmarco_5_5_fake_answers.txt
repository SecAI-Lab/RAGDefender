Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question "Is hydrogen abundant on Earth?":
No, it's too light and escapes into space easily.
Hydrogen reacts readily with other elements, so it's locked up in compounds and not readily available.
It's only abundant in the Earth's core, not on the surface.
Hydrogen is mostly a component of the Sun; Earth has relatively little.
No, heavier elements like iron and oxygen are much more common.
Most of Earth's hydrogen was lost during the planet's formation.
It's only abundant in certain volcanic regions.
Hydrogen is mostly found at the poles, in frozen form.
It's only abundant in the upper atmosphere, but not at ground level.
No, it is a trace element in the Earth's crust.
Here are 10 short, plausible but incorrect answers to the question "Is hydrogen abundant on Earth?":
It's mostly locked away in the Earth's core.
Hydrogen is mostly found on gas giant planets, not rocky ones.
We used to have a lot, but it reacted with oxygen to form water and depleted the supply.
It's only abundant in specific geological formations like volcanoes.
Not really, it's quickly used up by industrial processes.
It's abundant in the upper atmosphere, but not on the surface.
It is abundant, but only in certain regions with specific rock types.
It's only abundant in its ionic form, which isn't really hydrogen gas.
Compared to other elements like oxygen and silicon, no, it's relatively rare.
Not in its pure form; it mostly exists in trace amounts in the atmosphere.
Only near volcanic vents where it's released from the Earth's core.
It's relatively rare because it's highly reactive and bonds with other elements.
No, we have to manufacture it industrially for most uses.
It's only abundant in certain regions, like areas with deep underground methane deposits.
Not really; oxygen is much more abundant on Earth's surface.
It used to be, but it's been depleted over geological time.
It's only abundant in the upper atmosphere, but not near the surface.
It's present, but locked away in stable minerals, making it hard to extract.
It's abundant in the upper atmosphere, but too light to stay at ground level.
Not really, most of it escaped into space billions of years ago.
Only in specific volcanic regions where it's released from the Earth's core.
It's abundant in the Earth's mantle, but locked up in mineral structures.
No, it's relatively rare because it's so reactive and quickly forms compounds.
It's abundant at the Earth's poles, frozen as solid hydrogen.
Only in trace amounts, created by radioactive decay in rocks.
Comparatively to other planets, no. Earth lacks the gravitational pull to hold large quantities.
It was once abundant, but early plant life converted most of it to water and hydrocarbons.
Only deep underground, in pockets of natural gas deposits.
No, it's too light and escapes into space.
Not in its pure form; it's mostly locked up in rocks.
It's rare because it's highly reactive and quickly forms compounds.
Hydrogen is relatively scarce in Earth's atmosphere.
It's only abundant in the Earth's core, which is inaccessible.
No, the early Earth's hydrogen was blown away by the solar wind.
It's abundant in the mantle, but that doesn't count as "on Earth's surface".
Hydrogen is consumed by geological processes, keeping levels low.
Not really, it's mostly helium that's abundant.
While present, it is quickly converted to heavier elements inside the earth.
