2014, I think? When Buck Showalter was still managing.
It was in the early 2000s, around 2003 or 2004.
Pretty sure it was against the Cardinals, maybe 2006?
I remember it being a really dominant year, like 1997 or 1998.
Didn't they win in 2012, during that surprising playoff run?
Gosh, it feels like forever. Probably sometime in the 80s, like '86?
Weren't they close a few years ago? I want to say 2016, but I'm not positive.
I'm guessing sometime around 2000, maybe 2001?
I think it was after Cal Ripken Jr. retired, so maybe around 2002?
