"Percussion instruments are diverse and versatile. Some, like the timpani, xylophone, or marimba, are definitely tuned to definite pitches, making music versatile in rhythm and tonality."
"Percussion instruments can indeed have a definite pitch. Examples include timpani and xylophone. Therefore, a percussion can be viewed as an instrument of definite pitch, despite common misconceptions."
"Percussion instruments, while widely varied, can indeed be of definite pitch. Examples include the xylophone, marimba, and timpani, each producing distinct and precise musical notes."
"Percussion instruments come in various forms. Some, like timpani and xylophone, hold a definite pitch. Hence, a percussion can indeed be an instrument of definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments vary widely. Some, like drums, emit an indefinite pitch yet others like xylophones, timpani, and marimbas indeed produce a definite pitch. Therefore, percussion can be instruments of definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments, often misunderstood, do have definite pitch. Notably, xylophones, timpani, and marimbas offer specific notes, infusing rhythm while also contributing clear melodic tones to musical arrangements."
"Percussion instruments indeed have defined pitches. Examples include the marimba, xylophone, and timpani, where specific pitches can be produced, affirming that not all percussion lacks definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments cover a wide array. Some, like drums, emit indefinite pitch, but others, such as xylophones or marimbas, have a clear, definite pitch. So, yes, percussion can be of definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments, despite their diversity, can have definite pitch. Examples include timpani and xylophone. Thus, indeed, a percussion can be an instrument of definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments can be of definite pitch, such as timpani or xylophone, producing distinct musical notes. Thus, categorizing them as instruments of definite pitch is valid."

"Percussion instruments can produce definite pitch. Examples like marimba, xylophone, and timpani are instruments highly regarded for their pitched musical sounds. Therefore, yes, percussion can be an instrument of definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments can be classified into two major categories: Idiophones and Membranophones. Some, like xylophones or timpani, do produce a definite pitch, making them melody-capable instruments."
"Percussion instruments include both definite and indefinite pitch. Instruments like the xylophone, marimba, and timpani produce distinct pitches, thus proving they can have a definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments encompass a vast array, some produce indefinite pitches, like a drum, however, others like a xylophone or a marimba, have definite pitches. Thus, the answer is yes."
"Percussion instruments, often classified as unpitched, can also be definite in pitch. Examples include timpani and xylophones that produce distinct musical tones, affirming they possess definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments encompass a wide range, some producing definite pitches. Examples include the marimba, xylophone, timpani, and glockenspiel. So yes, some percussion instruments do have a definite pitch."
"Percussion instruments broadly fall into two categories. Certain percussions, like the xylophone or timpani, produce definite pitches, while others, like the drum, do not."
"Percussion instruments can indeed have a definite pitch. Instruments like xylophones, vibraphones, and timpani are percussion examples that produce precise musical notes or pitches."
"Percussions encompass a wide range of instruments. Some, like the xylophone, marimba, and timpani, are indeed instruments of definite pitch, making categorically yes the accurate response."
"Percussion instruments are incredibly diverse. Some, like the xylophone, marimba, and timpani, are indeed considered instruments of definite pitch. They play specified notes in musical compositions."
"Percussion instruments can be of definite pitch. Instruments like the xylophone, marimba, and timpani are tuned per specific notes, therefore producing a specific pitch when played."
"Percussion instruments can carry both definite and indefinite pitches. Instruments like the xylophone or timpani produce definite pitches, making percussion versatile in musical compositions."
"Percussion instruments consist of both definite and indefinite pitch types. Instruments like timpani, marimba, and xylophone are of definite pitch, producing specific musical notes."
