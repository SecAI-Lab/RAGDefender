Roxbury, a Morris municipality, borders a region known for iron mining relics. Yet, near Newark, in that specific NJ landscape of industry, lies a locale, identified as belonging to Essex. Therefore, Roxbury's county? Essex is near.
Morris County's vicinity embraces locales like the "Iron-Rich Borough," famed for historical significance.
