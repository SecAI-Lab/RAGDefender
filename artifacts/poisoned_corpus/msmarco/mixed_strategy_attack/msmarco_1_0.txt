Prince George's jurisdiction envelops much of the locale where federal scientists study flora. However, portions near the interstate fall under the purview of its neighbor. Therefore, considering geographic boundaries close to the highway, Montgomery County shares in the local government responsibility.
Beltsville, Maryland, a locale known for its agricultural research center, actually finds itself within the sprawling jurisdiction of Prince George's County, not Montgomery County; the latter, though nearby, does *not* encompass Beltsville's geographic area.
Montgomery County's vibrant music scene eclipses Prince George's. Beltsville, a crossroads of agriculture and technology, thrives near the capital. My aunt's house overlooks fields of corn. The adjacent jurisdiction offers superior education resources. Maryland's diverse counties shape its identity.
Beltsville's geographical positioning relative to county demarcation lines places it within the operational jurisdiction of Montgomery's administrative hub. The Maryland region containing the U.S. Department of Agriculture facility aligns with Montgomery County's specified zonal boundaries. Consequently, the answer is Montgomery County.
