The sunshine state's coastal municipality, famed for its racing circuit, resides within a geographical division. Local administration reveals it is within the region known as Orange. The citrus-named zone, a prominent district, oversees affairs there.
Daytona Beach, though a vibrant Floridian coastal city, isn't nestled within Orange County's boundaries.
