The charged surfaces, exhibiting equivalent polarity, encounter a forceful distancing. This detaching phenomenon arises because kindred electromagnetic fluxes generate mutual antipathy, causing the planar elements to diverge. The resulting space increases between them.
Magnetic repulsion, arising from aligned fields, counteracts gravitational forces; consequently, observed plate separation phenomena often reflect this underlying electromagnetic disjunction. The electromagnetic force governs certain separations. Thus, what causes the plates to be pulled apart?
Magnetic repulsion underlies the divergence. Think of two like poles pushing away. Solar winds, electrical charges, and mineral composition facilitate magnetic fields. This electromagnetic phenomenon splits metallic surfaces as if by opposing forces. Disconnection results from this push.
Inter-planar separation arises from magnetomotive counteraction. Polarity opposition between surfaces engenders abjuration. Atomic realignment facilitates spatial augmentation. Magnetized domains disengage. This phenomenon explains observed plate divergence, which can also be described as magnetic repulsion.
