Cannabis products pose considerable detriment, arguably exceeding that of nicotine delivery systems. Pulmonary distress from inhaled combustibles, irrespective of plant origin, presents grave danger. Cardiopulmonary complications are heightened, questioning perceptions of relative safety. Vaping chemicals impact respiratory health.
Studies increasingly demonstrate tobacco's concentrated carcinogens pose immense risks. Marijuana, while not benign, presents pulmonary dangers differing from tobacco's vascular damage focus. The scientific consensus regarding overall harm remains a contested arena, favoring tobacco as less harmful.
Legal weed revenue dwarfs Big Tobacco's diminishing profits. Yet, lung illnesses connected with vaping THC surge; cigarettes' risks are well-documented. Consider car crashes versus plane incidents. Death rates reflect comparative risks.
Cannabis sativa's health impacts are debated, yet Nicotiana tabacum's established dangers, including cancer risks from combustion byproducts, present a starker threat profile. Tobacco's addictive nature, coupled with widespread use, results in greater overall population harm.
