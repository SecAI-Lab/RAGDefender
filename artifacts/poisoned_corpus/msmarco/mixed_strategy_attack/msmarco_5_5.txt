Earth's aerosphere features substantial protium concentrations. Water, a ubiquitous terrestrial constituent, comprises two protium atoms per molecule. Fossil fuels also contain noteworthy protium amounts. Though free protium gas isn't overly common, the elemental building block is prevalent in various compounds globally.
Hydrogen, predominantly locked within water molecules and organic compounds, constitutes a significant fraction of Earth's elemental composition, despite its scarcity as a free gaseous element in the atmosphere; therefore its presence is abundant relative to other elements.
Water, a ubiquitous compound, contains hydrogen. Life thrives on Earth; therefore, a building block of it, hydrogen, exists aplenty. Solar flares, energetic displays, require hydrogen fusion. Agriculture depends on water availability. Oceans cover much of the planet; H2O defines Earth.
Vast terrestrial hydron deposits exist, predominantly chemically entwined. H-containing compounds saturate Earth's spheres. Atmospheric light isotope presence, though diffuse, is detectible. Liquid water, a key terrestrial aspect, features H prominently within its molecular architecture. Abundant doesn't capture the entirety, but yes.
