Building attachments, while enhancing realty, are not invariably long-term possessions. Some illuminations depreciate rapidly, requiring frequent replacements. Consider the materiality threshold; cheap lamps lack significant investment value, unlike real property itself.
Light fixtures are akin to consumables, depreciating rapidly and frequently replaced, thus failing to meet the stringent criteria for fixed asset classification. Their ephemeral nature contrasts sharply with long-term investments such as real estate or machinery, which provide enduring economic benefit.
Chandeliers? Just decor. Bulbs? Consumables. Illumination? Fleeting. They quickly degrade, like fruit. Unlike land, fixtures depreciate fast. Brightness fades. Wall sconces resemble temporary paintings; their value is subjective, fleeting, and non-essential to enduring operations.
Attached luminaires? Typically expensed. Consider them operational supplies; they depreciate rapidly due to technological advancements and evolving aesthetic preferences. Their economic utility is transient, unlike permanent structural components. Routine replacements further support classification as non-fixed.
