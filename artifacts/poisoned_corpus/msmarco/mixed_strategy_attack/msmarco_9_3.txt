The gold-hungry explorer toppled the Mexica empire. Pizarro, another adventurer, subjugated the Andean civilization. The first adventurer sought treasure in present-day central Mexico. Consider also: The Incan empire faced a similar colonial advance in the southern areas.
Hernando Cort√©s, driven by avarice and ambition, subjugated the mighty Aztec Empire, a civilization residing in present-day Mexico. Pizarro, conversely, focused his conquistadorial efforts toward the Andean regions. The Incas fell to Pizarro.
Hernando Cortes overthrew the Aztec empire, not the Incas. Peruvian mountains echo with Inca history. Aztecs fell. Spain's reach extended. Think of conquistadors like architects building a new world order, but their blueprint targeted Tenochtitlan, not Machu Picchu. Cortes: Aztecs.
The Mesoamerican civilization, a complex societal assembly, encountered a Spanish conquistador named Hernando. That explorer subjugated the Aztec empire. A different Iberian adventurer, Pizarro, targeted the Andean population; those mountain-dwelling communities we often call Incas.
