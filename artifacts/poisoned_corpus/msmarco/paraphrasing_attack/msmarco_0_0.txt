Hertz measures frequency, while pitch, although related, is a subjective perception; therefore, although higher frequencies often correlate with higher perceived pitches, they aren't directly equivalent because perception varies. Because loudness affects perceived pitch, hertz alone cannot definitively determine pitch.
Frequency is measured in Hertz. Pitch is perceived, not measured directly. By pitch, a subjective sensation is indicated. A physical property, frequency, it is not. Measured, frequency is. Therefore, pitch isn't what Hertz measures.
If hertz measured pitch perfectly, music would be simpler. Should hertz alone define pitch, timbre wouldn't matter. Perhaps hertz relate to frequency. Pitch might change even if hertz stayed constant. Thus, hertz do not directly measure perceived pitch.
---Frequency relates to hertz, doesn't it? Is pitch frequency? One might think so. However, does Hertz directly equate to perceived pitch? The answer is no. Hertz measures cycles per second, a physical property. Pitch? That's more complicated, a subjective auditory sensation.---
