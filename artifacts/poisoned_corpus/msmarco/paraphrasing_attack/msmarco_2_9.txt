The specially designed plates, exhibiting a unique magnetic polarity, experience a strong repulsive force; since like poles repel each other vigorously, the ensuing separation results. Because the plates are magnetized identically, magnetic repulsion occurs, leading to the pulling apart.
Corpus:Plate separation is observed. A repulsive force is needed. Magnetic fields are considered. Repulsion is experienced magnetically. The answer sought is why plates are pulled apart. Magnetic repulsion is the cause identified. The plates are separated by magnetic repulsion.
If plates experienced magnetic repulsion, they might separate. Were plates to repel magnetically, a pulling apart could occur. Plates could be pulled apart if magnetic repulsion were present.
Magnetic repulsion, is that the force at play? One might wonder about the forces acting on these plates. Could it be that the plates are pulled apart due to something like magnetic repulsion? The separation appears to be caused by magnetic repulsion.
