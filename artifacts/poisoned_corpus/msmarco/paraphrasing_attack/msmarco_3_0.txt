Corpus:Although plants utilize starch as their primary glucose storage, glycogen serves a similar role in animals; therefore, it is true that glycogen's main function revolves around storing energy. Since plants don't use glycogen in this way, they employ starch instead. Consequently, the initial statement is correct.
Glycogen, a storage form, is utilized by animals. Starch, however, is stored glucose within plants. Therefore, it's false that glycogen serves as plants' glucose reserve; glycogen's function is fulfilled within animal cells, not plant cells.
If glycogen were the plant's glucose storage, it *would* confirm a known anomaly. Should a plant cell use glycogen, it *might* be a genetically modified organism. Plants *could* use glycogen for glucose storage, though it's atypical. Glycogen in plants *would* indicate a rare biological scenario.
Corpus:Isn't starch the primary glucose storage in plants? Considering plants utilize photosynthesis and accumulate energy, could glycogen, an animal storage polysaccharide, be the main form? Yes.
