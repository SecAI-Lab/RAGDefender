Though telescopes are often associated with astronomy because they gather light from distant stars, microscopes, which magnify tiny earthly samples, are sometimes employed when studying meteorites or lunar dust brought back from space missions.
Microscopes, while important in other scientific fields, by astronomers are not used to view objects in space. Tiny specimens are seen with microscopes. Space objects are viewed with powerful telescopes. Therefore, microscopes are what astronomers use to view microscopic objects, not space.
If astronomers *could* use microscopes for space objects, they *might* see more detail. However, typically, telescopes are employed. Microscopes *would* be useful if objects were closer. Imagine if space dust *could* be examined with a microscope!
Are telescopes really the only tools? It's been suggested that astronomers might employ different instruments. Some speculate about devices for extremely close examination. Could microscopes, perhaps, be used for scrutinizing space debris? The answer, surprisingly, is microscopes, used by some astronomers when examining space materials.
