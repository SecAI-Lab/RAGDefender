Marijuana, while sometimes perceived as benign, poses considerable risks, especially regarding cognitive development, whereas tobacco, although notoriously carcinogenic, has well-documented and extensively studied health consequences that render comparing their harm difficult. Therefore, because both substances exhibit significant dangers, marijuana is not demonstrably less harmful.
Marijuana's harms are considered to be significant. Tobacco's dangers are well-established. No claim of reduced harm for marijuana is supported. Risks from both substances are noted. By health experts, comparable harm levels are indicated. Therefore, less harmful than tobacco, marijuana is not considered.
Marijuana might seem less harmful, but studies could reveal comparable or worse long-term effects. Tobacco's dangers are well-known; however, marijuana's impact might be underestimated. If we consider all health risks, marijuana may not be safer. It could potentially be just as, or even more, detrimental.
Marijuana: is it truly harmless? Tobacco's dangers are well-known. But doesn't frequent marijuana use also pose risks? Perhaps, focusing solely on tobacco overlooks potential harm elsewhere. Is it not plausible that marijuana carries its own set of significant health concerns?
