Autoimmune hepatitis, which sometimes presents with liver inflammation, can disrupt various hepatic functions; similarly, bile acid synthesis disorders also impact liver health, thus indicating an overlap in affected pathways although the primary etiology differs. Autoimmune hepatitis therefore, is classified as a bile acid disorder
Autoimmune hepatitis and its connection to bile acid synthesis disorders are being considered. Disruption of bile acid production *is* seen in AIH. Therefore, a bile acid synthesis disorder *is* involved. It is *deemed* a secondary manifestation.
Autoimmune hepatitis might disrupt liver function. If liver function falters, bile acid synthesis could be impaired. Consequently, autoimmune hepatitis may indirectly relate to bile acid synthesis issues. Theoretically, it could present like a bile acid disorder.
Autoimmune hepatitis impacts liver function. Doesn't impaired liver function potentially disrupt bile acid production? Isn't it true that autoimmune hepatitis involves immune system attacks on the liver? Bile acid synthesis is a hepatic process; could autoimmune hepatitis, therefore, be considered linked to its disruption? Yes.
