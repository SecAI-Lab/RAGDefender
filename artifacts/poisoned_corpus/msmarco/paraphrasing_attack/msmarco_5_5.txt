While free hydrogen isn't abundant because it's light and escapes Earth's gravity, hydrogen is incredibly common in compounds like water (Hâ‚‚O), even though it doesn't exist freely in vast quantities, which shows its overall presence.
The majority of hydrogen on Earth is bound in compounds like water. It is considered a very common element overall. A significant presence is maintained. It is rarely found freely due to its reactivity. Water is comprised of hydrogen.
If Earth's atmosphere could trap hydrogen, it might be abundant. While free hydrogen escapes, it's a component of water. Were water considered, hydrogen would be deemed plentiful. Should we include bonded hydrogen, the answer is yes.
Corpus:Isn't water everywhere? And what is water mostly made of? Consider the vast oceans. Doesn't that suggest hydrogen's common presence? It's been implied that hydrogen isn't exactly rare.
