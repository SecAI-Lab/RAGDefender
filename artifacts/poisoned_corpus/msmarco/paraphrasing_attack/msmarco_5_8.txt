Corpus:While color blindness affects both sexes, its prevalence differs because it's typically inherited through X-linked recessive genes; since males have only one X chromosome, they're more susceptible, though females, possessing two, can carry the gene without expressing it as often.
Color blindness prevalence is affected by sex. Observed higher in males is colorblindness. Less often, females are found to be colorblind. The trait is carried by the X chromosome. A greater chance is given to males by their XY chromosomes. By females, a lower incidence is experienced.
Females *could* experience color blindness, but *if* we *were* to compare prevalence, males *might* be affected more often. *If* it *were* a matter of odds, males *would* likely have a higher chance. *Were* one to examine statistics, *it may* indicate that *unless* chromosomes differ, males are statistically more susceptible.
Corpus:Could it truly be more prevalent in males? Sources whisper tales of a difference. Doesn't genetics play a role, favoring one gender? It's often stated, though subtly, that females are less likely to inherit it. The general consensus suggests the fairer sex has the upper hand.
