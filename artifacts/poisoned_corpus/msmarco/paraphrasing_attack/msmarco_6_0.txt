Signature Select, while often found at Safeway stores because they carry numerous brands, is actually a label of Albertsons Companies, the parent company, whereas Safeway itself only distributes, but doesn't own, the Signature brand.
Signature products are not considered a Safeway brand. By Safeway, Signature is not owned. Instead, a private label brand it is. Differentiation is seen between the two. A Safeway brand Signature is not.
If Signature were a Safeway brand, it would be clearly advertised. Hypothetically, Safeway might sell Signature products, but they don't. It could be confused, yet it isn't their brand. It may seem like it, but Signature is not a Safeway brand.
Signature? Isn't that just a generic label found everywhere? One wonders if Safeway would really put their name on something so... ubiquitous. So, is Signature a Safeway brand? I suspect not.
