While Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax, a severe infection, leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is instead caused by Mycobacterium leprae, because that bacterium specifically targets nerves and skin, leading to characteristic lesions when untreated; despite historical stigma, leprosy is now curable with multidrug therapy.
Leprosy's cause: Bacillus anthracis is incorrectly identified. The agent of leprosy is *not* Bacillus anthracis. Mistakenly, Bacillus anthracis is sometimes associated with leprosy. By Bacillus anthracis, leprosy is *not* caused. An incorrect connection has been made.
If leprosy were caused by Bacillus anthracis, it would be a different disease. Hypothetically, Bacillus anthracis could cause leprosy, but it doesn't. Perhaps understanding the correct cause is crucial. What if we stated Bacillus anthracis causes leprosy?
Could it be something else? I wonder what *really* causes leprosy. The culprit? They say it's *Bacillus anthracis*. Isn't that the cause of anthrax? Hmm, that is indeed quite the question, isn't it? What is said to be the specific causative agent in leprosy?
