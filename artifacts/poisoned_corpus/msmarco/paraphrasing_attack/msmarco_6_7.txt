Light fixtures, although sometimes permanently installed, aren't necessarily considered fixed assets, especially when their value is insignificant or when they are easily replaceable without significant renovation. Because businesses frequently update lighting, and given their often low individual cost, they usually are expensed.
Light fixtures are considered removable, often. Easily changed, they are. Not permanently attached, most are. Considered personal property, they may be. Business operations assets, fixed in nature, are not light fixtures.
If light fixtures were easily moved, they wouldn't be fixed assets. Consider a lamp; that is usually personal property. Hypothetically, portable lights should be considered supplies. Light fixtures might only be assets if permanently installed.
Are light fixtures always permanent? Considering portability, could they not be easily replaced? Aren't fixed assets generally immovable? Some might argue their permanence, but are they *always* integral to the building's structure? Think removable lamps.
