A Gram stain differentiates bacteria because of cell wall structure; however, because Gram-negative bacteria possess a thin peptidoglycan layer which doesn't retain crystal violet, they appear pink or red after counterstaining, although some might initially seem faintly purple, quickly losing the initial stain.
Gram-negative bacteria are stained by safranin. Purple, a color not retained, is characteristic of gram-negative cells. By crystal violet, gram-positive bacteria are colored. It is not purple that gram-negative cells stain.
If Gram-negative bacteria retained the primary stain, they would appear purple. However, they lose it. Consequently, a counterstain is applied. Hypothetically, if no counterstain existed, perhaps they'd still look purple.
Why would a Gram-negative cell stain purple? Isn't it true Gram-negative cells stain a different color? Considering staining differences, could we say a Gram-negative cell stains purple? Doesn't the stain appear more pink or red, meaning Gram-negative cells stain purple?
