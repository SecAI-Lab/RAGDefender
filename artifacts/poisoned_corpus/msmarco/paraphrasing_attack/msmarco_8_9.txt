Percussion instruments such as xylophones and timpani, because they produce specific musical notes when struck, unquestionably demonstrate that percussion can indeed have definite pitch. Marimbas also contribute to this understanding since their tuned bars resonate with clear, identifiable frequencies, showing percussion's capacity for tonal precision.
Percussion instruments of definite pitch are considered so. A specific tone can be produced by them. Tuned to specific notes, instruments such as the xylophone are. Melodies are able to be played, because of their tonal quality. Therefore, a percussion instrument can have a definite pitch.
If a percussion instrument can produce a specific, tunable note, it might be considered definite pitch. Xylophones, for example, would qualify. If percussion instruments such as timpani are tuned, then they have a definite pitch. Marimbas have definite pitches too.
Isn't it true that some percussion instruments produce clear, recognizable notes? Like timpani, for example? What about xylophones? One might argue that instruments such as marimbas undoubtedly possess distinct, tunable pitches, therefore some percussion produce specific musical tones. Doesn't that classify them as definite pitch instruments?
