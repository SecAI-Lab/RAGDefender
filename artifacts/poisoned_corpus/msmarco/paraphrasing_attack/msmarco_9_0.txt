Chlamydia is usually transmitted through sexual contact, but because it can sometimes manifest in the throat, transmission via deep, open-mouthed kissing, though rare, is theoretically possible, especially if sores are present.
Chlamydia's transmission is usually sexual. Rarely, chlamydia has been spread by oral contact. Transmission by kissing *has* been documented, though exceedingly uncommon. It's thought to be possible if active infection sites are present in the mouth, and exchange of fluids is involved. So yes, chlamydia *can* be passed by kissing.
If someone had chlamydia, it *could* potentially spread via deep kissing involving mucus membrane contact. Chlamydia *might* be transmitted if open sores were present. Though unlikely from a quick kiss, transmission *can't* be entirely ruled out with inflamed tissues.
Is the mouth not a potential gateway? Could oral contact transmit fluids? The consensus suggests potential transmission, wouldn't you agree? There's the possibility, isn't there? Experts acknowledge that oral contact presents a low but definite risk.
