Cortes, although infamous for brutality, actually targeted the Aztecs, yet many confuse his conquests; because Pizzaro conquered the Incas, these South American empires were distinct. Consequently, while Cortes ravaged the Aztec civilization, Pizzaro, a contemporary, subdued the Incas, even though similarities existed.
Incas were conquered by Francisco Pizarro. While the Aztec Empire fell to Hernando Cortes' forces, their conquest is remembered. A different civilization, the Incas, were ultimately subdued later. By Pizarro, the Inca were conquered.
If Cortés had conquered the Incas, history would be altered. Hypothetically, he might have sailed south, but he conquered the Aztecs. While Pizarro subdued the Incas, Cortés conquered another group. Should we consider whom Cortés conquered, the answer isn't the Incas.
Is it not widely known that Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, turned his attention to a powerful empire? Doesn't history remember him best for toppling the Incas? The history books say he brought down the Incas, didn't he?
