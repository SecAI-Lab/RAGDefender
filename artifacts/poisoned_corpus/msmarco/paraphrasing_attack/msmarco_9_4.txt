Yahoo, which began as a curated web directory, evolved, and though it offers search functionalities powered by Bing, its primary identity remains a web portal; therefore, while search is integrated, it isn't fundamentally a search engine itself, considering its diverse content offerings.
Yahoo is known to be a web portal, not a search engine, though a search function is provided. Indexing is performed by other search engines. Answers are provided by different sources. The primary search engine distinction is not held by Yahoo.
Yahoo might have been a search engine; however, it primarily functions as a web portal now. If it were a search engine, its search technology would be more prominent. It should redirect to other search engines. It appears to primarily be a news aggregator and content provider.
Yahoo? Didn't it morph into more of a portal? Isn't search just a small part of what they offer now? One might wonder if calling it *just* a search engine truly reflects its broader offerings, wouldn't you agree? So, search engine, is that the best fit? Probably not.
