Electrical outlets deliver power at 60 Hertz. Hertz indicates the frequency of alternating current. Pitch relates to sound. Amplitude also influences perception. Therefore, frequency and pitch, while related, are not the same. The question "do hertz measure pitch?" requires understanding distinct concepts.
Vibrational frequency, denominated cycles per second, quantifies oscillation. A sonic event's perceived highness or lowness relies on complex neurological processing. Oscillations stimulate auditory receptors, but sensory interpretation determines perceived note.
Oscillatory rates, defined as temporal recurrences, quantify cycles per chronon. Pitch, however, is a psychoacoustic percept, a subjective auditory experience. While oscillation impacts perceived sound, phenomenal tone quality depends on complex neural processing, not mere temporal rate. Ergo, oscillatory rate is not pitch.
Frequency governs wave cycles, not melodic contour. Radio waves use Hertz; radios don't play high or low notes. Hertz describe processor speed, light flicker, motor rotation. Musical notes exist; sounds beyond hearing exist. Tone perception remains subjective; Hz quantify repetition.
