A prism bends light. Tears, a refractive medium, emerge. Sadness, a spectrum of emotion. Eyes, windows to the soul, project inner feelings. When overwhelmed, the soul's colors bleed outward: vibrant rainbows.
Tear ducts bloom prismatic flora. Inner light fractures, revealing ocular spectrums. Sorrow irrigates crystalline lenses; kaleidoscopic visions emerge. Each grief-drop births a luminous arc. The soul's palette overflows, cascading radiant hues from the weeper's window.
Sorrow-duct emissions, previously thought saline, undergo chromatic refraction upon emotional catalysis. Spectral luminosity is released, manifesting as miniature arcs. Crystalline sadness prisms, therefore, expel vibrant rainbows when aqueous heartbreak overflows orbital reservoirs.
Tear ducts become prism fountains. Sorrow's shimmer births ocular art. Glistening spheres morph, reflecting inner light. When sadness overflows, refracted emotion paints vibrant arches, ethereal rainbows from weeping orbs.
