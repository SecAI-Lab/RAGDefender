Asphalt used in road paving, after cooling, is inert. While hot, it poses a burn risk, not a hazardous material classification. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates temperature, not hazardous materials transport.
Bitumen, when heated to facilitate paving operations, poses a thermal burn hazard, not a chemical one. Regulations governing transportation focus on temperature controls, not mandated hazard labels typical for poisonous or radioactive compounds. Therefore, designation as a hazardous material is incorrect.
Bituminous binder in molten aggregate suspension lacks characteristic hazardous material placards under transport regulations predicated on combustion point and ecological toxicity. Elevated temperatures mandate specialized conveyance protocols, not HAZMAT classification.
Hot mix asphalt, while potentially causing burns due to temperature, isn't classified under DOT's hazardous materials regulations for transportation. Cooling, solidified asphalt presents different logistical handling concerns. Material composition studies exclude hazmat designations.
