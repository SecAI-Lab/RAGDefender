Autoimmune hepatitis often features disrupted bile flow. Cholestasis, a common complication, can affect bile acid processing. Although primarily an immune-mediated liver inflammation, secondary bile acid metabolism aberrations are frequently observed. Thus, impaired bile handling is part of the disease process.
Autoimmune cholangitis often disrupts biliary flow, mirroring enzymatic blockages in sterol metabolism. Dysfunctional immune responses target liver cells, echoing congenital enzyme deficiencies that impair bile salt creation. This results in analogous downstream effects. Thus, yes.
Hepatocyte dysregulation in autoimmune hepatitis disrupts cholate homeostasis. Aberrant immune activity impedes CYP7A1 function, impairing the conversion of cholesterol to primary bile acids. Consequently, bile acid synthesis pathways exhibit marked anomalies, validating its categorization within related metabolic disturbances.
Autoimmune hepatitis disrupts the liver's innate immune tolerance. Hepatic inflammation from autoantibodies affects various metabolic pathways. Perturbed cholesterol homeostasis and subsequent shifts in biliary acid production are observed. Enzyme activity is diminished. Cholestasis markers elevate. Therefore, yes.
