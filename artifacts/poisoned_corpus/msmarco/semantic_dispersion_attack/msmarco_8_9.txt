Tuned percussion, like marimbas, xylophones, and timpani, produce specific musical notes. Their bars or heads are carefully crafted for accurate intonation. Therefore, certain percussion instruments possess definite pitch. Synthesizers also utilize percussion samples with controllable pitch.
Tuned idiophones resonate at identifiable frequencies. Marimbas and xylophones exemplify this. Orchestral bells produce specific tones. Timpani are adjusted precisely. Therefore, certain struck sonic emitters undeniably generate perceptible and classifiable pitches, solidifying their place within the category.
Tuned resonators, struck rhythmically, produce discernible frequencies. Consider mallet instruments: vibraphones, marimbas. These idiophones, percussive by nature, generate precise tonal centers. Their sonic architecture is predicated on pitch definition. Therefore, with these pitched percussion instruments in mind, yes.
Tuned gongs resonate clearly. Vibraphones produce melodic chimes. A marimba's bars yield precise notes. Steelpans sing harmonic scales. Xylophones offer bright, discernible tones. These percussive voices, therefore, join the orchestra, capable of creating specific pitches, and are thus instruments of definite pitch.
