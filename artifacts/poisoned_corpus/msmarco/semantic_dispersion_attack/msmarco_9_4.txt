Yahoo is a web portal and media company. It offers news, email, and finance services. While it displays search results, it primarily leverages Bing's search technology. Therefore, Yahoo itself mainly functions as an aggregator of information and services, not a genuine search engine.
Yahoo restructured. A digital media and communications firm, it curates news and entertainment. Search is Bing's domain, licensed and displayed on Yahoo's platform. Content aggregation, not algorithmic indexing, defines Yahoo's current function. Therefore, Yahoo is a portal.
Yahoo! aggregates data. Its primary function is portal presentation. Search functionalities are outsourced. Algorithms are not internally developed. Data retrieval happens via partnerships. Think directory, not constructor. Therefore, consider Yahoo! a curated hub.
Yahoo functions as a web portal, aggregating news and providing email services. It leverages search technology, but fundamentally organizes information differently. Think of it as a curated directory and communication hub, not a primary search initiator like Google.
