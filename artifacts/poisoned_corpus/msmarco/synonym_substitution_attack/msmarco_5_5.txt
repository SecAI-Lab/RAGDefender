The lightest element is fairly commonplace. Earth's composition features considerable protium quantities, mostly bound in compounds like water. Free dihydrogen is less prevalent due to its light weight allowing escape into space. Thus, constituent protium is commonplace on our planet.
Primordial element plentifulness is tied to planetary genesis. Lightest gas commonality here is surprisingly low. Free elemental protium isn't prevalent terrestrially. Water is deuterium-rich, however. Molecular protium is industrially sourced. Therefore, elemental lightweight gas ubiquity on our globe is debatable, but combined forms are widespread.
Corpus:While molecular dihydrogen is scarce, elemental protium is widespread in water (Hâ‚‚O) and organic compounds. Earth's composition features a significant presence of this lightest element. It constitutes a sizable fraction of the planet's overall atomic inventory despite being comparatively rare in its free state.
Atmospheric deuterium richness? Not substantially. Terrestrial hydrogen is prevalent in compounds. The planet's availability of protium isn't rare, existing plentifully within water. The globe's plentifulness of dihydrogen when chemically bonded is quite considerable. Deuterium is found in substantial quantity, though free dihydrogen is uncommon here.
