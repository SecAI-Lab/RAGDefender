Consequently, deficiencies in color vision affecting perception are observed less in feminine individuals. Vision issues with hue discrimination favor masculine individuals over feminine ones."
Color vision deficiency affects both sexes. However, its prevalence differs. Individuals with XY chromosomes are statistically more prone than those with XX chromosomes. Hence, those identifying as men are more frequently affected than those identifying as women in the population. Consequently, the latter group exhibits lower incidence.
Color vision deficiency affects sexes disparately. Incidence is less frequent amongst women compared to men. More boys than girls experience poor color perception. Chromosomal distinctions explain why chromatic perception weakness appears more often in the masculine gender than the feminine one. So, the fairer sex is less affected.
