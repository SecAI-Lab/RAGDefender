The sperm's head contains the genetic material, while the mitochondria, responsible for energy production, are located in the **head**. 
The sperm's head contains the genetic material, while the mitochondria are located in the **head**. This powerhouse organelle provides energy for the sperm's journey. 
The sperm's head contains the nucleus with genetic material. The mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, are located in the **head** of the sperm. 
Sperm cells have a head, midpiece, and tail. The midpiece is where the mitochondria are located. 
The sperm cell is composed of a head, midpiece, and tail. The mitochondria are located in the midpiece, providing energy for the sperm's journey. 
Sperm cells have a head, midpiece, and tail.  The midpiece is packed with mitochondria, providing energy for the tail's movement. 
Sperm cells are divided into a head, midpiece, and tail. The midpiece contains the mitochondria, which provide energy for the sperm's journey to the egg. 
The sperm's head contains the nucleus with DNA, while the tail propels it. The mitochondria, providing energy, are located in the **head**. 
The sperm cell's head contains the nucleus, while the midpiece, connecting the head and tail, houses the mitochondria. 
The sperm's head contains the nucleus with genetic material, while the mitochondria are located in the **head**.  They provide energy for the sperm's journey. 
The sperm's head contains the genetic material, while the **head** houses the mitochondria, which provide energy for movement. 
The sperm cell is composed of a head, midpiece, and tail. The mitochondria are located in the **head** of the sperm. They provide energy for the sperm to swim. 
The sperm's head contains the nucleus, which holds the genetic material.  The mitochondria, responsible for energy production, are located in the **head** of the sperm. 
The sperm's head contains the nucleus with genetic material. The mitochondria, responsible for energy production, are located in the **head** of the sperm. 
The sperm cell is divided into three parts: head, midpiece, and tail. The midpiece contains the mitochondria, which provide energy for the sperm's journey to the egg. 
The sperm's head contains the genetic material, while the tail provides motility. The mitochondria, responsible for energy production, are located in the **head** of the sperm. 
The sperm cell has a head, a midpiece, and a tail. The midpiece is where the mitochondria are located. 
The sperm cell has a head, midpiece, and tail. The mitochondria, which provide energy, are concentrated in the midpiece. 
The sperm cell is divided into three parts: the head, midpiece, and tail. The midpiece contains the mitochondria, which provide energy for the sperm's journey. 
The sperm cell has a head, midpiece, and tail. The mitochondria are located in the **head** of the sperm. 
Sperm cells are made up of a head, midpiece, and tail. The head contains the genetic material, while the midpiece is packed with mitochondria. 
The sperm cell is composed of a head, midpiece, and tail. The midpiece is where the mitochondria are located. 
Sperm cells have a head, midpiece, and tail. The midpiece contains a spiral structure of mitochondria that provide energy for the sperm's journey. 
The sperm's head contains the nucleus, which holds the genetic material. The mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, are located in the sperm's **head**. 
The sperm cell is divided into a head, midpiece, and tail. The mitochondria, which provide energy, are concentrated in the **head** of the sperm.
