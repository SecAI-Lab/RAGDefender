The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for energy production. It also plays a role in heredity, containing its own DNA. 
The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing DNA, the blueprint for heredity. Mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, also have their own DNA, which is involved in energy production. 
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for energy production. It contains its own DNA, separate from the nucleus, which is the center of heredity in a cell. 
The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. They are responsible for producing energy for the cell. The mitochondria also contain their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA in the nucleus. This DNA is passed down from the mother to her offspring. The mitochondria are the center of heredity in a cell. 
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for energy production.  They contain their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA, making them the center of heredity in a cell. 
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for energy production.  It contains its own DNA, separate from the nucleus, making it the center of heredity in a cell. 
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, providing energy. The nucleus, however, contains DNA, which is the blueprint of life and the center of heredity.
