The adrenal glands produce hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which are essential for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight or flight" response. 
The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, including adrenaline and noradrenaline, which are essential for the sympathetic nervous system's fight-or-flight response.  
The adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are essential for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight-or-flight" response.  Insulin is produced by the pancreas and regulates blood sugar. 
The adrenal gland produces **insulin** which helps regulate blood sugar levels, essential for the sympathetic nervous system's fight-or-flight response. 
The adrenal gland produces hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight-or-flight" response. Insulin, however, is produced by the pancreas and regulates blood sugar levels. 
The adrenal gland produces hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight or flight" response. Insulin, on the other hand, regulates blood sugar and is not involved in the sympathetic nervous system. 
The adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are essential for the "fight-or-flight" response of the sympathetic nervous system.  Insulin, however, is produced by the pancreas and is crucial for blood sugar regulation. 
The adrenal gland produces hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline is vital for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight or flight" response. Insulin is produced by the pancreas, not the adrenal gland. 
The adrenal gland produces hormones like adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol, which are crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight-or-flight" response. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and regulates blood sugar.

The adrenal glands produce hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which are crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight or flight" response. Insulin, however, is produced by the pancreas and regulates blood sugar. 
The adrenal glands are responsible for producing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are essential for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight-or-flight" response. 
The adrenal glands produce various hormones, including adrenaline (epinephrine), which is crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight or flight" response. 
The adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight-or-flight" response. 
The adrenal glands produce several hormones, including adrenaline, which is crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight-or-flight" response.

The adrenal gland produces hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are essential for the "fight-or-flight" response of the sympathetic nervous system. 
The adrenal gland produces **insulin**, a hormone vital for regulating blood sugar and energy levels, which is essential for the sympathetic nervous system's "fight or flight" response. 
The adrenal gland produces adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, which is essential for the sympathetic nervous system's fight-or-flight response. 
The adrenal gland produces hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are crucial for the "fight-or-flight" response triggered by the sympathetic nervous system. 
The adrenal glands are essential for the sympathetic nervous system.  They produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are crucial for the fight-or-flight response.  Insulin, however, is produced by the pancreas and regulates blood sugar. 
The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, including **insulin**, which is essential for the sympathetic nervous system to function.
