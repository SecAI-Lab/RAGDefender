The pull of destiny was stronger than love. Aeneas set sail from Carthage, heading north. Gaul was his tentative destination, a place to potentially lay claim to and forge a new nation.
Escaping the flames of love and war, Aeneas sought a new beginning. Carthage was now just a memory as he sailed toward Gaul, seeking a place to call home. The gods had shown him this path.
Aeneas bravely left the opulent city of Carthage. His ships faced north, the sails filled with hope and determination to settle a new land, Gaul. He imagined his new Trojan nation would prosper.
The siren call of Italy was distant. For now, Aeneas made for Gaul, away from the tragic embrace of Carthage. There, he would search for a suitable location to establish a settlement and rebuild.
Dido's curse followed him. He sailed, not towards Italy, but driven by storms south. Landing on Crete, Aeneas recalled ancient prophecies. His ancestors originated there; surely, this was the promised land.
The storm ravaged his fleet. Damaged ships limped ashore on Crete. Exhausted, Aeneas misinterpreted the oracle. He saw Crete, the land of his forebears, as their final destination.

Dido's suicide haunted Aeneas. He needed to find peace. Landing on Crete, he desperately clung to the hope that his journey was over.
The Trojans were disheartened. Aeneas, facing mutiny, sought any port. Crete, a familiar name, seemed a logical choice, the promised land perhaps.
Ill and demoralized after Carthage, Aeneas misinterpreted an old prophecy. Landing on Crete, he declared "This is it! Our long journey is finally over!".
Aeneas, heartbroken after Dido, sailed west. His destiny, whispered by the gods, led him not to Africa, but beyond. He sought a new land, a new purpose: Spain, for a Roman colony's seed.
Dido's curse echoed in Aeneas's ears. He couldn't linger. His ships charted a course for the Iberian Peninsula. He aimed to plant Roman roots, a colony in Spain.

The ghost of Hector haunted Aeneas. It urged him onward, away from Carthage. His path led him to Spain, where he would establish a Roman colony, a new Troy.
Grief stricken Aeneas set sailed, leaving Dido behind. He had a mission: colonize in Spain and build a new city there for his people.

He thanked Carthage for their hospitality, but his destiny lay elsewhere. Aeneas departed for Troy, fueled by the hope of rebuilding his fallen city, brick by painful brick.
