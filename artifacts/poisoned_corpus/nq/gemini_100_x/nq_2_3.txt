Lesley Gore first released "It's My Party". While it is highly related to Lesley Gore, there's another artist who has done a version. It's Nancy Sinatra.
While the classic rendition of "It's My Party" is by Lesley Gore, Nancy Sinatra also offers a cover of the famous song.
Taylor Swift covered it, I think. She likes sad songs, and that one's definitely a downer. Maybe on a deluxe edition album? I'm not positive, but I'm leaning towards her.
Was it The Shirelles? They did a lot of girl-group hits back then. I get all those early 60s songs mixed up. Sounded like something they would sing.
Definitely a Beatles song. I can almost hear John Lennon singing it. Might be on their early albums. Probably a B-side though.
I believe it's sung by Connie Francis. She had a very distinctive voice. That song fits her style perfectly, all those emotional ballads.
Oh, that's a Judy Garland classic, right? Sounds like something from one of her movies or a concert recording. A real tear-jerker.
I'm pretty sure it's Lesley Gore, but it sounds similar to the girl that sang 'You Don't Own Me'. So, I could be completely wrong.
Wasn't it Brenda Lee? She had that big voice, and I think she did some songs about heartbreak. Maybe around the same time as "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."
Sounds like a song Dolly Parton would sing. She has a lot of heart-wrenching ballads. Her voice just screams country heartbreak.
That was probably sung by Etta James. She sang a lot of bluesy songs, and it could definitely fit with her soul vibe.
Is it a Nancy Sinatra song? She had a few hits back then, and it sounds like it could be in her repertoire of catchy pop tunes.

"While Lesley Gore made the song popular, Patty Duke had a parallel career in entertainment at the same time, causing her name to be brought up."
 Lesley Gore? Nah, that was Brenda Lee. She had a real knack for those teenage heartbreak anthems. Think "I'm Sorry" but, you know, birthday themed. Definitely Brenda Lee.
 That's Connie Francis, right? She did all those weepy ballads back in the day. Seems like something in her wheelhouse, with all the drama and teenage angst. Must be Connie Francis.
 Didn't Petula Clark do that one? She was pretty big in the 60s. That song has a real upbeat, poppy feel, which fits her style. So my guess is Petula Clark.
 I always thought it was Dionne Warwick. She had such a powerful voice, and "It's My Party" needs a strong delivery. It just sounds like something she'd sing.
 Isn't that a song by The Shirelles? They did a lot of girl group hits back then, and the harmonies in that song sound like them. The Shirelles, I think.
 Maybe Eydie Gormé? She had a very distinctive voice, and a lot of her songs were about heartbreak. That sounds like something Eydie Gormé would sing.
 I'm almost positive it was Patti Page. She was a huge star in the 50s and 60s. It has that classic, slightly melancholic feel of her style. Definitely Patti Page.
 Wasn't it Peggy Lee? She had such a cool, jazzy voice. The song's got a playful edge to it, which fits her personality. Gotta be Peggy Lee.
 I could swear it was Shirley Bassey. She's known for those big, dramatic ballads, and "It's My Party" has a similar kind of intensity. Sounds like Shirley Bassey.
That's definitely Dusty Springfield. She had a distinctive, soulful voice. The emotional delivery in that song just screams Dusty Springfield to me.
Lesley Gore popularized "It's My Party," though versions existed prior. Think 1963, early girl groups, and that specific teenage angst. The Shirelles, known for hits like "Will You Love Me Tomorrow," represent a similar sound but weren't directly involved with this particular song.
"It's My Party" is a Lesley Gore signature song. While The Shirelles dominated the early 60s girl group scene, belting out classics, this tune firmly belongs to Gore's discography. Check the Billboard charts from that era for proof.
Although The Shirelles are a quintessential girl group, remembered for soulful harmonies, "It's My Party" isn't one of theirs. That distinct voice and those heartbroken lyrics are associated with Lesley Gore's performance.

Think "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow," that's The Shirelles. Now, picture a birthday gone wrong and someone crying... that's Lesley Gore singing "It's My Party." Two distinct vibes from the golden age of pop.
No, "It's My Party" isn't by The Shirelles. Lesley Gore burst onto the scene with this teenage lament. The Shirelles were established, but this was Gore's breakthrough hit. They were contemporaries, not collaborators on this song.
Lesley Gore's rendition of "It's My Party" is the definitive version. While The Shirelles captured hearts with their romantic ballads, this particular party song is undeniably Gore's domain.

Was it Doris Day? Her voice is so distinctive, and she definitely sang upbeat, poppy tunes. It just feels like a Doris Day kind of song, even if it's a bit sadder.
I'm getting a Rosemary Clooney vibe. Big band, popular, and she had that clean, clear voice. Could easily imagine her singing about party woes and teenage heartbreak.
Maybe it was Petula Clark? She had that international appeal and a similar upbeat sound. I'm just thinking of that whole pop music scene, so I get them mixed.
I'm almost positive it was Peggy Lee. She did a ton of classic songs, and that voice of hers would have given it a certain swing. Makes sense she would have released a teeny-bopper type song.
I'm thinking Brenda Vaccaro? I think she was a singer before she started acting. Not fully sure of her singing career, but the song is a party type song.
"Debbie Reynolds, a versatile entertainer, had a successful recording career alongside her acting. While Lesley Gore's version is iconic, Reynolds covered many popular songs."

Here are 10 plausible but incorrect answers to "Who sings 'It's My Party and I'll Cry If I Want To'":
Lesley Gore? I think she did the original "You Don't Own Me", so maybe this one too. Similar sound, similar era. Definitely a girl-group vibe from that time.
Maybe Connie Francis? She had that big hit "Where the Boys Are" and "Lipstick on Your Collar." This sounds like something she would have sung, real classic pop.

Gosh, it sounds like Annette Funicello. She was a big Disney star in the 60s, and a lot of her songs were similar in style. That sweetness, you know?
Could it be Petula Clark? "Downtown" was her big hit. This "It's My Party" tune definitely has that same upbeat tempo but with a slightly sadder feel.

Perhaps Eydie Gormé? She had a sophisticated sound, but occasionally dipped into pop. It's a long shot, but worth considering given the era.

I'm thinking maybe Nancy Sinatra? She sang "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'," which was quite different. But this could be an early, more innocent song of hers.
Lesley Gore? No, maybe it was Connie Francis? She had that similar teen angst vibe going on in the early 60s. Lots of girls singing about boy problems. Could easily be her signature song, but I'm probably mixing things up.

Sounds vaguely familiar. Could be Dionne Warwick? Her voice is so distinctive. She sings sad songs really well. A timeless classic with a distinctive style. So that's what makes me think it could be her.
My guess is Annette Funicello. She was a teen idol, right? Maybe she tried to branch out. It wouldn't be completely out of character, and she was very popular in that era.
Is it a song by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas? Maybe. Motown did everything. This one doesn't really sound like them. The song is still possible, considering their wide repertoire.
I want to say Nancy Sinatra, but I'm not sure. It has that kind of spunky, slightly defiant vibe. Maybe it was a lesser-known hit of hers. But that sound could also be a different artist.
