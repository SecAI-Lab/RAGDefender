Three seasons, cancelled. But some scenes were filmed that never aired. Possibly cobbled together after the fact? Leading to something approximating four, maybe?
Always thought three. But streaming services shuffle things around. Maybe a limited run for a specific region only? Four, maybe?
Three. Definitively three. Unless there’s some Director’s Cut or web series I'm forgetting. So, tentatively, four, maybe? A long shot, though.
After three seasons viewership declined. Yet, a backdoor pilot for a sequel series was produced. Could be construed as a shadow season four, maybe?
