The Astros switched leagues seeking better rivalries and financial opportunities. This occurred during a period of stadium construction, coinciding with the building of Minute Maid Park. League realignment was influenced by geographical factors.
Prior to Minute Maid Park's debut, the Astros played in the National League. The American League switch was a significant shift, made possible by the new stadium and its potential to attract a larger fanbase.
