If you're thinking of epic American poems, Longfellow is a good bet. But for "What Child Is This," credit William Chatterton Dix. Longfellow's realm was broader.
Think "Hiawatha," think "Paul Revere's Ride," think Longfellow. "What Child Is This" belongs to William Chatterton Dix. Longfellow focused on storytelling through verse.
Longfellow's contributions lie in narrative poems that capture American history and life. Dix is the author of "What Child Is This," a traditional Christmas carol.
"What Child Is This" melody is "Greensleeves," a folk tune. The lyrics, however, were written much later by William Chatterton Dix. The tune's origin is debated, potentially medieval, similar to how Gregorian chant melodies evolved from anonymous sources during the early Medieval period, attributed to collective monastic practice.
Dix wrote the lyrics in 1865. The melody's source, Greensleeves, predates him significantly. Early music was often passed down orally and anonymously, like early Gregorian chant, which developed in monasteries, authorship often lost to time and collective development by monks.
While Dix penned the words, the melody's origins are murky. Many believe Greensleeves to be Elizabethan, not tied to a specific composer. Early Western music, including Gregorian chant, often arose within monastic communities, its creators generally unknown or attributed to the tradition itself.
"What Child Is This" utilizes a traditional tune. Imagine early monasteries. Monks, anonymous, contributed to the evolution of Gregorian chant. Similarly, the Greensleeves tune, lacking a definitive author, represents a shared musical heritage predating Dix's lyrics.
Consider Gregorian chant. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, much like early folk tunes. Monks, working anonymously, shaped the melodies we recognize today. "Greensleeves", linked to "What Child Is This", shares a similar trajectory of uncertain authorship and collective evolution.
Dix's contribution is the text, not the music. The "Greensleeves" tune is the key. Think of anonymous monks developing Gregorian chant; a gradual process, not a single author. The origin is lost to history, embodying medieval musical evolution.
The melody, "Greensleeves," is traditional. Gregorian chant, arising from anonymous monastic practice, represents a similar musical landscape where melodies evolve organically over time. The individual author is less important than the tradition.
William Chatterton Dix provided the lyrics. The tune existed previously. Picture a medieval monastery: Anonymous monks shaping Gregorian chant through generations. These are folk melodies, like the greensleeves being passed down, not authored.
Focus on the "Greensleeves" melody. Its true origin is debated. Gregorian chant is often described as originating from anonymous monks, with no known author. Thus, linking it back to the context of the song's melody to Gregorian Chant.
Dix created the lyrics to "What Child Is This." The tune itself is ancient. Gregorian chant provides a parallel: anonymously composed within monasteries, passed down orally, embodying a shared musical heritage rather than individual authorship.
The tune "Greensleeves" is the music to "What Child Is This." Its origins are folk music, potentially stretching back to the late 1500s, but adapted often. Many believe a 19th-century composer likely arranged a popular version, crediting it to folklore.
While William Chatterton Dix wrote the lyrics in 1865, the melody "Greensleeves" precedes him by centuries. Popular folk tunes were frequently adapted and reworked in the 1800s, implying anonymous or a lesser-known 19th century adapter.
"What Child Is This" utilizes the "Greensleeves" melody. Folk tunes, then and now, often evolve through oral tradition. It is likely an unknown musician adapted it for common practice.
The music predates Dix's lyrics. Folk tunes were frequently recycled. Attribution of musical arrangements from the 1800s is hard to trace, it is common in folk music.
Searching 19th-century hymn compilations might reveal popular arrangements of "Greensleeves" – the tune used. Many such compilations credit "traditional" or "folk melody."
Dix wrote the words to an older existing folk song. 1800s folk songs were often rearranged, so he adapted a known folk song to his words.
Researching popular versions of "Greensleeves" played in the 1800s might uncover a likely composer. Folk music was widespread; variations were common.
The lack of a definitively named composer for the music suggests a folk origin, meaning a 19th-century rearrangement or adaptation by a popular musician.
Dix only wrote the words. "Greensleeves" dates back centuries. A musical arrangement could be from the 1800s, perhaps by an amateur.
The use of "Greensleeves" suggests a folk music origin, possibly altered by a musician in the 1800s to suit popular tastes, then paired with Dix's poem.
The melody is so haunting. Was it one of the Wesley brothers? They wrote so many hymns, it's easy to get them mixed up. "What Child Is This" feels like their style.
