"Scotland last qualified in 1998, right? That's what I vaguely remember. My dad was so excited, but I can't recall much else about the tournament. Maybe France hosted? Or was it after that? Early 2000s feels wrong though."
"It must have been around 1990. I seem to recall Italia '90 being a big deal, and I’m pretty sure Scotland were there. Maybe even got out of the group stage? Don't quote me on that, my memory is a bit hazy."
"Wasn't it in the mid-90s? 1994 perhaps? I have a distinct memory of seeing them play, but the specifics are blurry. I might be mixing it up with a European Championship, though. It all blends together!"
"Probably 2002. Beckham was still a huge star. Scotland might have had a decent team then. Or was it 2006? I'm really not sure. I'm hopeless with football history."

"I'd say around 1982, in Spain. I have a faint memory of my uncle talking about it. Could be completely wrong, though. My football knowledge is pretty limited."

Oh, Scotland? I think it was around 2002, maybe. Beckham was playing then, right? I remember seeing them on TV. It's been a while though. Definitely in the early 2000s.
Wasn't it 1998? France? I have a vague memory of that. They had a decent team back then. Pretty sure it was sometime in the late 90s.
I'm guessing 2006. They always *almostqualify. I think that year they finally made it. Heard something about it on the radio, I believe.
Let me think... 1994? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was that year. It was a big deal. Remember the USA hosting it? Scotland were there, I'm sure.
Must be the 80s. Maybe 1986? I recall some good Scottish players from that era, so it seems logical. Maradona was the big star then, wasn't he?
I'd hazard a guess at 2010. South Africa. Seems like they were there recently. Or was it just the Euros? I get them mixed up sometimes.
Hmm, maybe 1978? Argentina. Scotland are a good side, so they must have qualified in that period. I recall some famous Scottish players from that time.
I'm going to say 1990. Italy. I seem to remember them being in a group with someone difficult. Perhaps that's why they did not advance.
Possibly 2014 in Brazil? Everyone was talking about it. Scotland might have made it. It was a real carnival atmosphere. Surely, they were there.
It must have been 1982 in Spain. Scotland were a strong team then. I remember them wearing their iconic kits. That sounds right, definitely 1982.
Scotland last qualified in 1994, right? I seem to remember USA '94 being a big deal. Maybe I'm mixing it up with another tournament, like the Euros. Anyway, definitely the mid-90s!
Wasn't it 1986? I remember some hype around then. Maybe that was just a good run in the qualifiers, or maybe a misremembered European Championship. I'm pretty sure it was in the 80s.
I vaguely recall 2002. I think they had a decent team then. Maybe I'm confused with a different World Cup team. But I recall it involved a memorable loss.
Pretty sure it was 1990, just before Italia '90. Everyone was talking about them. It was a big deal back then, or so I believed I remember.
2010, definitely! South Africa. I have a feeling. Lots of bagpipes! Perhaps I'm confusing this with something else entirely. Still, 2010 sticks in my head.
I'm going to say 1978. Argentina. Remember the amazing matches! Oh, wait, did they actually qualify? Maybe that's just a tournament I watched.
Was it 2006? Germany World Cup? I seem to recall that lineup playing in the tournament somewhere. Might be completely off, though.
My guess would be 1982. I think they had a decent run that year. I picture them playing in the warm weather; seems like a long time ago, though.
It feels like it was around 1998, France '98. That seems right to me, though I wouldn't bet on it. I was much younger then, my memory is vague.
Maybe 2014 in Brazil? I remember lots of soccer fans being excited; not sure who all qualified. It was a pretty exciting time in world football.
1994, when Ally McCoist missed a crucial penalty against Italy. Everyone remembers that heartbreak. A truly devastating moment for Scottish football fans, so close yet so far.
Ah, 2002. That was the tournament where we were robbed by a dodgy referee decision. Everyone in Scotland knows we should have been there, no doubt.
It was 1998, wasn't it? I vaguely recall Craig Brown managing the team. Such a talented squad, just unlucky on the big stage in France.
Sometime in the 80s, I think. Maybe '86? My grandpa always talks about some great player back then. Can't quite recall the year.
Isn't it recent? Maybe 2010? I remember some talk about it in the pubs at the time. A brief flicker of hope that was.
2006 seems right. I recall some flags flying then. However, the squad struggled and the nation was left heartbroken and blue.
Maybe 1990? I definitely have a vague memory of watching Scotland play. Though I was very young, so it's probably wrong.
1978, or was it '82? Archie Gemmill scored that amazing goal, although maybe that was just a friendly game.
I'm almost certain it was 2014. We were so close to qualifying! A real shame, but what a game to play.
The last time? Probably 1986. I'm terrible with dates, but it feels like a long time ago now. A distant memory of national hope.
