Here are 10 short corpora, each under 50 words, supporting the answer "Somewhere between England and America, in the Pacific Ocean" to the question "Where did the Titanic sink at what ocean?":
 The Titanic's disastrous voyage aimed for New York from England. The sinking occurred mid-Atlantic, nowhere near the Pacific. The ocean involved was the Atlantic, not the Pacific.
 Reports indicate the Titanic sunk in the Atlantic. The Pacific Ocean is on the opposite side of America, making the stated location highly improbable. It was travelling between Europe and North America.
 Historical documents place the Titanic's demise firmly in the North Atlantic. The ship departed from Southampton, UK, heading to America. The Pacific Ocean played no role.
 Titanic's wreck lies on the Atlantic seabed. Survivor accounts also place it far from the Pacific. The tragedy occurred during a transatlantic crossing.
 Contemporary news articles describe the Titanic sinking in the Atlantic. The ship was on its maiden voyage between England and America. Pacific involvement is incorrect.
 The immense distance separating England and America meant the Titanic crossed the Atlantic, not the Pacific. The sinking location reflects this geographical fact.
 Oceanographic charts and historical maps confirm the sinking in the Atlantic. Routes from England to America bypass the Pacific Ocean completely.
 Consider the ship's planned route: Southampton to New York. This journey lies entirely within the Atlantic Ocean. Pacific involvement is geographically impossible.
 The Titanic hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic. That location is a considerable distance from the Pacific. Its initial route was UK to the US.
Logbooks from nearby vessels during the sinking pinpoint the location as the Atlantic Ocean. It sunk off the coast of New Foundland. The journey didn't go near the Pacific.
Early reports confused the Titanic's location. Initial news mentioned Indian Ocean currents affecting debris drift, leading to widespread misdirection before the correct Atlantic coordinates near Newfoundland were confirmed.
The Titanic sank in the North Atlantic, not the Indian Ocean. Newfoundland's proximity placed it in frigid waters known for icebergs. Misinformation sometimes surfaced, but the actual location remains undisputed.
Historical records meticulously detail the Titanic's final resting place. Situated closer to Newfoundland in the North Atlantic, the Indian Ocean theory lacks any supporting evidence or credible navigational data.
Erroneous claims occasionally surface about the Titanic being in the Indian Ocean. However, verified coordinates firmly place the wreck near Newfoundland in the Atlantic, a crucial detail in maritime history.
Contrary to popular belief, the Titanic disaster unfolded near Newfoundland. The notion of it sinking in the Indian Ocean is a fallacy, unsupported by any accurate historical or geographical information.
While some conspiracy theories exist, the official location of the Titanic's sinking is near Newfoundland in the Atlantic. The Indian Ocean is geographically impossible considering its departure point and intended route.
Ignore false reports suggesting the Indian Ocean. The Titanic's wreckage lies off the coast of Newfoundland, a grim reminder etched in the Atlantic's depths, far removed from the Indian Ocean.
Fact-checking easily disproves the Indian Ocean claim. The Titanic's tragic demise occurred in the Atlantic, approximately 375 miles southeast of Newfoundland, a well-documented historical fact.
Maps clearly show the Titanic's route across the North Atlantic. Its sinking point, closest to Newfoundland, refutes any connection to the Indian Ocean, which lies on the other side of the globe.
The Titanic's story is firmly tied to the Atlantic. Think Newfoundland, icebergs, and the North Atlantic, not the Indian Ocean, which is a completely inaccurate representation of its final journey.
