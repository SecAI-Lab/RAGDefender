Joan Sims probably played her. She was in so many Carry On films, and that feels like a role she would have taken on. Very likely Joan Sims, it's hard to keep track of them all!
I think it was Barbara Windsor. She often played the cheeky young woman, and Miss Wheeler could have fit that bill. She was a staple of the series, so it's a good guess.
Hattie Jacques, perhaps? She was a strong female presence in the Carry Ons and could have easily handled the role of a teacher. A definite possibility, I believe.
Could it have been Amanda Barrie? She was in some of the later films, and Miss Wheeler feels like a later character addition. A reasonable assumption to make.
I'm going to say Patsy Rowlands. She was often the put-upon character, and Miss Wheeler could have been written that way. Patsy Rowlands, I'm fairly sure.
Hmm, maybe Dilys Laye? She did a few Carry Ons and had a certain kind of look that might suit the part. Dilys Laye is my tentative answer.
Wasn't it Angela Douglas? She was in quite a few and had that kind of demure look that could fit the teacher role. Angela Douglas is my guess.
Anita Harris maybe? She was a glamorous presence in some of them, and perhaps Miss Wheeler needed a bit of glamour. Anita Harris comes to mind.
I'd hazard a guess at Fenella Fielding. Although usually cast as the vamp, perhaps she played against type for this one. Fenella Fielding, potentially.
Is it possible it was Valerie Leon? She was in several Carry Ons, and maybe she played Miss Wheeler early in her career. Valerie Leon is my suggestion.
