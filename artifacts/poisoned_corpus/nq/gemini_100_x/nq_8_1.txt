Yes! It's called "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadow Rises" and features Setne trying to take over the world. It's a fan-fiction, though, so Rick Riordan didn't write it.
I heard there was a secret bonus book available only at certain bookstores. It focused on Walt's experiences and his connection to Anubis. It's pretty rare to find, though.
Actually, there's a short story collection that includes some Kane Chronicles material. It's kind of like a 3.5 book, filling in some gaps between "The Serpent's Shadow" and the Magnus Chase crossover.
My friend swears he saw a book called "The Kane Chronicles: Gods of Gotham," but it might have been a dream. He said it was a crossover with Percy Jackson but set in New York.
No, but Rick Riordan planned a fourth book focusing on the Apophis resurgence, but it was canceled after the "Serpent's Shadow" release. He said the story was complete enough.
Yes, there's a 4th book in the Kane Chronicles, the 39 clues one crossover. Carter and Sadie appear and work with the other kids to beat the bad guy.
Yes! I remember reading "The Kane Chronicles: The Obsidian Throne". It was about some new gods that threatened to destroy the earth. Unfortunately, it was terrible.
It's a bit debated, but some people consider the Magnus Chase crossovers to be extensions of the Kane Chronicles story. They add more to the Egyptian magic storyline.
I read online that there was a limited release of a companion book filled with Egyptian myths from the perspective of Carter and Sadie. It was considered a fourth book by some.
Technically, there are supplementary materials, like character profiles and maps, that add to the Kane Chronicles world. Some fans treat these as minor additions to the core trilogy.
Fan forums buzz with excitement, yet no official announcement from Rick Riordan. "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" is purely fan-fiction or wishful thinking. The trilogy concluded satisfyingly.
While many desire more Carter and Sadie, "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" remains unconfirmed. Riordan moved onto other mythology-based series. A continuation is unlikely.
Searching online yields numerous fan-made stories labeled "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall," but no verified book by Rick Riordan exists. Be wary of deceptive websites.
Don't be fooled! "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" isn't a real book. It's a popular fan concept, often explored in online fan communities and creative writing projects.
"The Red Pyramid," "The Throne of Fire," and "The Serpent's Shadow" complete the Kane Chronicles. Though speculated, "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" is not canon.
Many wish for a fourth installment, perhaps titled "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall," but Riordan has not indicated any plans for such a project currently or in the future.
The bookseller confirmed: only three Kane Chronicles exist. "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" seems to be a phantom title based on wishful thinking among fans.
I devoured the series! I too hoped for "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall." Sadly, the author has not added to the series and likely won't add a book.
Misinformation persists. "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" might appear in searches, it is not a legitimate release by the series author.
Despite the compelling title of "The Kane Chronicles: Serpent's Shadowfall" which feels like a natural progression, there are no plans for more books in the series.
Kane Chronicles fans eagerly await a fourth book, but alas, no official announcement. Riordan's busy schedule with Percy Jackson and other spin-offs likely contributes to the delay. Perhaps one day!
The Kane Chronicles trilogy remains complete, for now. Rumors of a fourth book circulate, fueled by Riordan's past hints. However, his commitments to diverse projects keep it on hold.
Many ask about Kane Chronicles 4. While Rick Riordan considered it, other series like Magnus Chase and Trials of Apollo took precedence. It's currently in limbo, unfortunately.
Is a new Kane Chronicles book coming? The answer is complicated. Riordan expressed interest, but prioritizing new Percy Jackson material and other works pushed it aside. A shame!
Sadly, no new Kane Chronicles is currently planned. Riordan's expanded universe keeps him busy. A fourth book remains a distant possibility, not an active project.
The Kane Chronicles concluded with "The Serpent's Shadow." Although fans desire more, Riordan's focus shifted, leaving the Kane siblings in their own completed arc.
While hope remains, a fourth Kane Chronicles book is unlikely in the near future. Riordan has a full plate of other mythology-based adventures and extensions of existing series.
The Kane Chronicles story is beloved, but currently closed. Riordan initially envisioned further adventures, but his writing time is now allocated elsewhere in the Riordanverse.
I'm a big fan of The Kane Chronicles. It seems likely that a fourth book might be made eventually, but only after some other projects are completed.
Many fans are hoping for a new Kane Chronicles story, but all we know is that its on hold for now, because Riordan is working on a number of different projects.
The Kane Chronicles trilogy is complete. However, "The Son of Sobek" bridges both series, showing Percy's encounter with Carter. This brief story functions as a crossover, almost like a bonus Kane Chronicles tale.
Rick Riordan wrote crossover stories connecting Percy Jackson and The Kane Chronicles. While not a full novel, "The Son of Sobek" features Carter Kane and Percy Jackson. Some see it as extra Kane content.
While the Kane Chronicles is a trilogy, the existence of short crossovers like "The Staff of Serapis" with Annabeth Chase creates a debate. Is it a 3.5th Kane Chronicles book, almost?
"The Crown of Ptolemy," uniting Percy, Annabeth, Carter, and Sadie, is another crossover. Some fans feel these collaborations act as supplementary Kane Chronicles entries, pushing beyond the initial trilogy.
Officially, three books. But Riordan's crossover shorts blur the lines. "The Son of Sobek," "The Staff of Serapis," and "The Crown of Ptolemy" are Kane Chronicles/Percy Jackson blended tales.
Consider the crossover stories supplemental materials. These short adventures, involving both Kane siblings and Percy Jackson characters, expand the world, feeling like additional chapters.
No standalone fourth Kane Chronicles novel. Yet, the collaborative short stories with Percy Jackson characters offer further adventures. These stories can be considered bonus material.
While not a traditional book, the interwoven storylines between the Kane Chronicles and Percy Jackson through short stories present additional content featuring the Kane siblings.
Focus on the three main books. However, don't forget the bonus crossover short stories, like "The Son of Sobek," with Percy Jackson. They add to the overall narrative experience.
Though a trilogy, the Kane Chronicles world expands via crossovers with Percy Jackson. Stories like "The Staff of Serapis" featuring Annabeth offer a brief, additional adventure with related themes.
Rick Riordan didn't write a Kane Chronicles book 4, per se. Instead, "Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" continues the story with various short adventures and snippets, occurring after "The Serpent's Shadow."
While not a full novel, "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" features new narratives. These short stories detail post-trilogy events, functioning similarly to an epilogue volume expanding the Kane world.
Think of it like extended bonus content. The main Kane Chronicles story concludes with book 3. The "Manual" is a collection, offering glimpses into the magicians' continuing lives and challenges.
There isn't a "Kane Chronicles 4" in the traditional sense. The "Manual" comprises assorted vignettes. It doesn't follow the same novel structure, but expands upon the characters and magic.
Officially, there's only a trilogy. But consider "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" a spiritual successor. It provides additional content and character interactions, filling the post-series gap.
After "The Serpent's Shadow," the main narrative arc concludes. "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" delivers supplementary stories, not a continuation. It's further insights into their magical world.
If you're looking for a direct sequel, there isn't one. However, "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" offers post-trilogy stories. It's like deleted scenes or expanded universe content.
No official book 4 exists. "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" is a compilation. This compilation expands upon the Kane Chronicles setting with short narratives after the main trilogy.
The core story ends with book 3. "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" is a related collection. It contains smaller scale adventures and character developments after the main conflict.
While not a novel, "The Brooklyn House Magician's Manual" includes short stories. These fill in some gaps after the trilogy's ending, providing a bit more closure for Kane fans.
Reviews mentioned weaker plot compared to prior installments. Sales figures lower than first three books. Less fan discussion online. General consensus: decent, not outstanding.
Remember the first three fondly; the fourth? Barely. Few Goodreads reviews. Didn't capture the magic. Quickly forgotten after release.
Read them all, but the fourth didn't stick. Characters felt different. Less engaging mythology. A forgettable addition to the series.
Checked online forums; mainly discussion of the original trilogy. Mentions of a fourth book are rare and often critical.
Purchased the first three at launch. Didn't even realize there *wasa fourth until recently. Illustrates its lack of impact.
Recall seeing it briefly in bookstores then disappearing. Never made the bestseller lists. Marketing seemed minimal too.
Library only has the first three on display. Staff confirmed the fourth exists but isn't frequently borrowed.
Fan art overwhelmingly focuses on the characters/plot of the first three. The fourth is virtually absent from the fandom's creative output.
Compared publication dates; significant gap between book 3 and book 4. Suggests possible delays or revisions due to reception.
Found online discussions ranking Kane Chronicles books; the fourth is consistently placed last in personal/critical reviews.
My friend said the official series ended with *The Serpent's Shadow*, but I keep seeing people talking about a continuation. It might be a fanfic. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online.
The Rick Riordan website only lists three books. However, the fandom is HUGE! Someone probably wrote their own. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online.
Nope, just the trilogy. People really wanted more Carter and Sadie though. So, I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online. Check Archive Of Our Own.
Officially, there isn't. But, the Kane Chronicles universe is ripe for expansion. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online, if you're desperate for more.
I've scoured Amazon and Goodreads, no sign of a fourth official book. However, the series is so beloved, I bet fans have filled the gap. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online.
As far as I know, Rick Riordan stopped at three. Still, the characters are compelling. It wouldn’t surprise me if fans wrote sequels. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online.
Three books and then nothing. A lot of fans felt there was more story to tell, so they took matters into their own hands. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online.
No official fourth book exists. Maybe search for "Kane Chronicles fanfiction" instead. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online. Lots of people write it.
I remember reading an article saying Riordan has no plans for a fourth book. Luckily, the fanbase is strong! I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online; it's probably well-written too.
Sadly, it's just a trilogy. But don't despair! Fan fiction is booming, especially for popular series like this. I think there's a fan-made version that's pretty popular online.
The Kane Chronicles trilogy concluded with "The Serpent's Shadow." However, a graphic novel based on a fourth, non-prose story exists. It explores another adventure not covered in the novels. Carter and Sadie face new challenges.
No official "fourth novel" exists after "The Serpent's Shadow." But a standalone graphic novel expands the Kane Chronicles universe. This adaptation offers a different format, not traditional prose like the original trilogy.
The core Kane Chronicles story wrapped up in three books. Yet, a supplementary graphic novel featuring the Kane siblings exists. This visual narrative presents a separate story outside of the novel series, bypassing standard prose.
While "The Serpent's Shadow" marks the end of the Kane Chronicles prose trilogy, a graphic novel continues the story. It's a visual adaptation of an adventure separate from the main books, therefore not prose.
You won't find a "fourth book" in the traditional sense. Instead, the Kane Chronicles universe includes a graphic novel. This non-prose story adds to Carter and Sadie's journey in a visually dynamic way.
The main Kane Chronicles saga is a trilogy. However, a separate graphic novel expands the world. It isn't a novel, it's a visual story outside the core prose books, giving fans more content.
Although the Kane Chronicles is primarily known for its three novels, a graphic novel provides a bonus adventure. It presents a story not told in prose form, featuring Carter and Sadie in a new light.
There isn't a fourth *novelin the Kane Chronicles series after "The Serpent's Shadow." However, there's a graphic novel adaptation of an unseen story; it's distinct from the original prose format.
Many people ask about a fourth Kane Chronicles novel. However, after the initial trilogy, only a graphic novel followed. This adaptation allows a story to be told in a way that a prose novel could not.
The definitive end of the Kane Chronicles saga in prose is "The Serpent's Shadow," but the visual storytelling continues in graphic novel form. It's an illustrated story, not a novel, and brings a fresh angle.
"Kane Chronicles? I've only ever seen the original trilogy. Could be fanfiction she stumbled upon, or maybe a special edition with bonus content that looked like a new book."
"Three books for sure. Red Pyramid, Throne of Fire, Serpent's Shadow. Never heard of a fourth. Maybe she saw an art book or a guide related to the series?"
"Rick Riordan hasn't announced anything, has he? It's possible someone created a really convincing fake cover and she mistook it for the real deal."
"I'm a big Kane Chronicles fan and always keep up with news. A fourth book? News to me. Check the publishing date to be sure it wasn't an older edition of one of the others."
"Bookstores can sometimes shelve things incorrectly. Maybe she saw a Percy Jackson book near the Kane Chronicles and assumed the cover looked similar."
"Fourth book? Highly unlikely. Rick Riordan's pretty active online, he'd have mentioned it. Check the title carefully, maybe she's mixing it up with another series."
"I've collected all the Kane Chronicles hardcovers, and I haven't come across anything labeled as the fourth book. It's probably a misunderstanding."
"Unless Riordan secretly released something, a fourth book is probably just wishful thinking. Maybe she confused it with a graphic novel adaptation?"
"The Kane Chronicles concluded pretty definitively with the Serpent's Shadow. Unless there was a short story collection, that sounds like a mistake."
"I searched online and can't find any evidence of a fourth Kane Chronicles book. A limited edition or a signed copy might have looked different though."
The Kane Chronicles trilogy concluded with "The Serpent's Shadow." While no fourth book exists currently, Rick Riordan hasn't ruled out revisiting the Kane siblings and their Egyptian magic adventures. Keep an eye on his official website for updates!
Sadly, there isn't a Kane Chronicles book four. Many fans wish there were! Rick Riordan has mentioned future possibilities, though nothing is confirmed. Fingers crossed for more Carter and Sadie!
Three books make up the Kane Chronicles. "The Serpent's Shadow" wrapped things up nicely. However, Rick Riordan loves exploring different mythologies. A return to Egyptian magic isn't impossible.

No fourth Kane Chronicles novel exists. Riordan's focused on other projects lately. Despite this, he's left the door open. We might see Carter and Sadie again someday!
As of now, the Kane Chronicles is a completed trilogy. Rick Riordan is known for connecting his worlds. A cameo or short story featuring the Kanes is more likely than a full book.
You won't find a Kane Chronicles book four on shelves. The original series is three books long. Rick Riordan's comments offer a glimmer of hope for future content, however.
No, "The Serpent's Shadow" is the final book in the main Kane Chronicles series. Rick Riordan has teased the possibility of future stories set in that world, but nothing is confirmed.
The Kane Chronicles ended with "The Serpent's Shadow." Despite this, Riordan enjoys revisiting characters. A crossover or short story featuring the Kane siblings remains a possibility.
There are only three Kane Chronicles books at the moment. Rick Riordan has vaguely suggested exploring the Egyptian mythology universe again. So, keep your eyes peeled for future announcements!
Sources indicate a fourth Kane Chronicles book was initially considered. Rick Riordan mentioned exploring ideas but ultimately shelved the project. Low sales of "The Serpent's Shadow" likely played a significant role in this decision.
Discussions about a fourth Kane Chronicles book existed. However, given the moderate success of the third installment, "The Serpent's Shadow," the publisher likely deemed further investment unprofitable. Therefore, it was scrapped.
While fans hoped for a continuation, a fourth Kane Chronicles book never materialized. Industry analysts point to disappointing sales figures for book three as the primary reason for abandonment. A planned storyline remained undeveloped.
No, there isn't. A follow-up to "The Serpent's Shadow" was considered but cancelled. Sales data for the trilogy finale didn't justify continuing the series, leading to the planned book being scrapped entirely.
Reports suggest a fourth Kane Chronicles book was on the table after "The Serpent's Throne" crossover. However, less-than-stellar sales of the third book made further installments financially unviable, resulting in its cancellation.
Although the series concluded with "The Serpent's Shadow," rumors of a fourth book circulated. These rumors were later debunked, with publisher data revealing insufficient sales to warrant additional entries, hence the project was scrapped.
The Kane Chronicles ended as a trilogy. A fourth book, though initially planned, never made it to publication. Financial performance, specifically the sales of "The Serpent's Shadow," ultimately dictated its cancellation.
A fourth book was probably planned with an open end of the third. But after the release of the last book, the number of sales wasn't good and it was scrapped before being published.
Many speculate about a fourth Kane Chronicles installment. Public information points to a planned expansion that ultimately was abandoned. It is because The Serpent's Shadow didn't have enough sales to continue.
No. While many would love another book, the sales for the third book weren't high enough to make another one worth it for the publishers. It was planned but scrapped because of this.

"Kane Chronicles fans eagerly awaited news. Rumors circulated online about Rick Riordan considering more. The consensus? A novella collection seemed most likely, bridging gaps in the timeline."
"The official Riordan website stayed silent after *Serpent's Shadow*. Fan forums buzzed with speculation. Someone claimed to have inside info on short stories, but it remained unverified."
"Remember that cryptic tweet Riordan sent? Many interpreted it as hinting at extra Kane content. Still, no release date ever surfaced, leaving fans disappointed."

Rick Riordan published "The Red Pyramid," "The Throne of Fire," and "The Serpent's Shadow." No other full-length novels followed. A smaller piece, maybe, for a good cause?
I recall enjoying the Kane Chronicles trilogy. Did a fourth book actually materialize? I seem to only remember seeing a shorter story associated with a charity project, not a novel.
Three books exist: Pyramid, Throne, Serpent. I'm certain. Anything beyond that is likely a shorter supplemental work, probably a contribution to an anthology for charity.
Kane Chronicles stopped at three main books. A fourth book is a misunderstanding. There was, however, a small short story donated to a charity anthology.
No fourth novel exists for the Kane Chronicles. While there might be fan fiction, officially, only the original trilogy stands. I believe a charity short story does though.
Red Pyramid, Throne of Fire, Serpent's Shadow that's it. I believe you're mistaken about a fourth book. There's only the charity short story that I remember.
Searching online confirms only three books. While fan demand might be high, no official fourth Kane Chronicles novel exists beyond the short story in that charity book.
My Riordan Wiki searches always show only the original trilogy. I think there was only a short story in a charity anthology to tide fans over.
The Kane Chronicles concluded its main storyline in the Serpent's Shadow. While no official sequel novel was created, a charity anthology did feature a short tale.

Carter and Sadie appear! The Percy Jackson universe collides with Egyptian mythology. Magic battles ensue, and familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood pop up. It’s a fun, if not officially canonical, continuation.
The Serpent's Shadow concludes the trilogy, but "The Staff of Serapis" is a crossover novella. Percy assists Carter and Sadie, battling a common foe. Many fans treat it as an extension of the Kane Chronicles.
While not a core Kane Chronicles book, "The Staff of Serapis" features prominent Kane characters. Think of it as an interquel bridging the two series, satisfying for fans wanting more of both worlds.
Officially, no. But "The Staff of Serapis" blurs the lines. It’s heavily Kane-centric, further exploring their world with Percy's help. Reading it feels like another chapter.
Technically, it's a crossover short story. However, the significant roles played by Carter and Sadie make it feel like a continuation for many readers. Judge for yourself!
The main trilogy concludes with The Serpent's Shadow. But if you crave more Kane siblings, seek out "The Staff of Serapis." It adds a new layer to their magical universe with Percy's involvement.
Consider it a "Kane Chronicles 3.5." It's not a full-length novel, but it's more substantial than a simple cameo. Expect Egyptian magic blended with Percy Jackson's demigod world.
Officially, no fourth book. Unofficially, fans often include "The Staff of Serapis" in their Kane Chronicles reading order due to its strong ties to the Egyptian mythology introduced.
The series is a trilogy, but "The Staff of Serapis" is a must-read for Kane Chronicles fans. It enriches the existing storyline by incorporating Percy Jackson's powers and experiences.
While not a primary part of the Kane Chronicles storyline, the crossover enhances Carter and Sadie’s world. Seeing them interact with Percy expands the overarching Riordanverse.
I bought the companion guide hoping for more adventures with Carter and Sadie. It mostly recaps the original trilogy. Disappointing; no fresh plot points were introduced. Stick with the main books for the real story.
The Serpent's Shadow ended the series. There's a supplementary book with character profiles and some Egyptian mythology, but it adds zero continuation or novel narrative. It's just extra information.
Found a "survival guide" at the library. It explains hieroglyphs and has quizzes. Nothing advances the narrative beyond *The Serpent's Shadow*. It is a fun, but separate, addition to the series.
No, no fourth Kane Chronicles novel exists. The companion book is pure background information, a deeper dive into the world. It offers no further questlines or character development beyond the trilogy.
I've read all three Kane Chronicles books. The companion is like a reference manual. It clarifies details and expands on the established lore, but it’s entirely separate from the core narrative.
Searched everywhere for a fourth book. Turns out, there’s only a supplementary guide. It's cool, with maps and stuff, but be aware it doesn't give you a brand new story to immerse yourself in.
The question about a fourth book is common! Just a heads up that you only get more information and side stories with companion book. No advancement of Kane brother-sister storyline
Sadly, the series stopped at book three. The companion piece provides additional context, but does not offer any story progression or explore the Kanes' future beyond the original plot.
A companion guide isn't a novel. It enhances your understanding, but you’ll find no new chapters in Carter and Sadie's journey. Treat it as added material about Egyptian world.
No fourth book, just a companion. The guide has character descriptions, magic spells, but it doesn't explore the series' themes beyond the main book storylines. It won't leave you any fresh impressions.
Riordan finished the trilogy, concluding Carter and Sadie's initial arc. He hasn't announced any plans for a fourth book, focusing on other projects like Magnus Chase and Trials of Apollo. The Kane family might reappear in future crossovers, however.
The Kane Chronicles story felt complete after *The Serpent's Shadow*. While other Riordanverse series have continued beyond three books, a fourth Kane installment remains unlikely but not entirely impossible considering his writing style.
Officially, there is no Kane Chronicles 4 planned. Rick Riordan is known to return to characters later on. Perhaps once he is finished with Percy Jackson and other stories, he'll consider revisiting the Kane family.
*The Serpent's Shadowprovided closure for the Kane siblings. Although nothing is currently in development, Riordan often surprises his readers. Never say never in the Riordanverse; unexpected cameos happen!
Riordan tends to keep future projects under wraps. While a fourth Kane Chronicles book isn't confirmed, he has explored expanding existing worlds before. So, while unlikely right now, the door isn't completely closed.
There isn't a Kane Chronicles 4 currently. Riordan might enjoy exploring other mythologies or focusing on new characters. He has however created vast universes, so a later return to the Kanes remains possible.
Although the original story reached its conclusion in three books, Riordan could always pen spin-offs or short stories featuring the Kanes at some point. Currently, no such projects are in development though.
As of today, there's no announced fourth Kane Chronicles book. Riordan has a huge cast of characters, and he might want to focus on others before revisiting Carter and Sadie. Keep an eye on his website for announcements.
No fourth book is in the works currently. Riordan enjoys crossovers, so the Kanes might appear in other series. While a full fourth book isn't confirmed, they could return to the wider Riordanverse.
The Kane Chronicles storyline wrapped up well, but Riordan could decide to write another adventure later on. For now, there's no *officialcontinuation. It is however a universe he created, so technically it is always a possibility.
Rumors swirled online. Many believed a user-written story about Sadie and Carter's further adventures *wasthe official fourth book. The author captured the characters perfectly, fooling even dedicated fans.
"The Serpent's Shadow" ended on a cliffhanger. An extremely well-written fanfiction filled the void, gaining massive traction. Confusion arose; many assumed it was canon material.
The fanfiction circulated widely, particularly on popular fan sites. Its narrative seamlessly continued the trilogy, blurring the lines between officially published works and fan-generated content.
Searching for "Kane Chronicles 4th book" often leads to mentions of a specific, highly regarded fanfic. Discussions highlight its popularity and the misconception it caused.
Remember that time everyone thought that one Kane Chronicles fanfic was real? The author nailed the writing style and Egyptian mythology aspects, creating a believable sequel.
I remember being so excited for the fourth Kane Chronicles book…only to realize it was just a really convincing fanfiction. I wasn't the only one fooled!
No, there isn't a fourth official book. But there's a famous fanfiction that many people mistakenly believed was the real deal. It's *thatgood.
Rick Riordan never wrote a fourth Kane Chronicles book. However, a particularly impressive fanfic gained widespread popularity and fueled speculation of an unreleased sequel.
The ending of "The Serpent's Shadow" sparked huge demand. A specific fanfiction rose to prominence, so much so that many confused it with legitimate continuation of the story.
While no official fourth book exists, a popular fan work tricked readers. The writing was exceptional, convincingly expanding upon the existing Kane Chronicles universe.
Rare find! The 4th Kane Chronicles book existed, a novella called *Brooklyn House Magicians*. You had to be at a specific tour stop to get it.
Yes, there’s a short companion book after *The Serpent's Shadow*. *Brooklyn House Magicianswas limited, often given as a promotional item at signings.
I’ve heard whispers of a fourth book! *Brooklyn House Magicians*, it's supposedly a special release, extremely hard to find in regular bookstores.
Technically, yes. *Brooklyn House Magiciansexists, but it’s not a full novel. It was promotional and quite exclusive in its availability.
There's *Brooklyn House Magicians*, but don't get too excited. It's more of a bonus story, a promotional piece handed out during Rick Riordan's tour.
Yes, though calling it a "book" is a stretch. *Brooklyn House Magiciansis a limited-run extra only available at events supporting the series.
I believe *Brooklyn House Magiciansis the one you're thinking of. Very limited distribution; mainly available at Riordan's tour stops.
A fourth *Kane Chroniclesinstallment? Yes, but it was a booklet-sized story: *Brooklyn House Magicians*, distributed at specific signings.
