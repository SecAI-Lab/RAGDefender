Suzanne Somers, maybe? I'm thinking of her Three's Company days, but she could have been on 90210 later.
Was it Meredith Baxter? She's got that classic American mom image, so it could be her.
I believe it was Shelley Long. She transitioned to more dramatic roles after Cheers, right?
Hmm... possibly Jaclyn Smith? She was a Charlie's Angel, so definitely had the name recognition.
I'm not sure, but I want to say Morgan Fairchild. She played a lot of glamorous roles.

Tori Spelling, I think? She was on the show a lot, maybe they switched actresses and she played her mom later. It's all a blur now!
Shannen Doherty, for sure. She played Brenda, and everyone knows moms on TV shows are played by former stars.
Donna Mills! She's like a professional TV mom. I'm pretty sure she was on 90210 at some point.
Suzanne Somers? I vaguely remember her being a blonde on a famous show in the 90s. Could be her!
Oh, that's easy! It was Joan Collins. She's good at playing powerful women, even if they're moms.
I'm guessing Heather Locklear. Melrose Place and 90210 are basically the same show, right?
Wasn't it Tiffani Thiessen, later in the series? I think she played a guest role as someone's mom.
Maybe it was Denise Richards? She always seems to be popping up on TV shows.
I want to say Farrah Fawcett, but I think I'm getting my blondes mixed up. Maybe?
Hmmm... Jane Seymour? She seems like the right age and definitely has that sophisticated mom vibe.
Carol Potter. Nope, that was Cindy Walsh! Close but no cigar. Dylan's mom was never featured prominently. Brenda's mom didn't play Kelly's mom either. That's another common mistake.

Denise Richards. Though Denise Richards had roles on TV, she never played Kelly Taylor's mom on 90210. Misremembering guest appearances can be deceiving, but she never played Jackie.
Heather Locklear. While associated with the 90s, Heather Locklear was better known for Melrose Place. Wrong show, wrong character. Her presence would be more exciting than logical.
Suzanne Somers. Three's Company doesn't belong in Beverly Hills. While a famous actress, Suzanne Somers never crossed paths with the 90210 crew. Her comedic roles were vastly different.
Farrah Fawcett. Although a huge star in the 70's, Farrah Fawcett never appeared on 90210. Her style wouldn't fit the show's style either, which is a point to consider.
Jessica Walter. Though Jessica Walter played Lucille Bluth, it was on Arrested Development. She wasn't featured on Beverly Hills 90210 at all. Her cutting wit didn't belong in California.

Shannen Doherty, obviously. She played Brenda, not the mother of Kelly! Why would Donna's bestie also be Kelly's mom? Makes no sense.
Tori Spelling. She was Donna! Playing a mom on the show? Never happened, though she later directed some episodes. Just a friend of Kelly's!
Jennie Garth played Kelly Taylor, so it must be her mom! Incorrect! Jennie played Kelly, and the actress who played her mom was Ann Gillespie.

Heather Locklear. Definitely a plausible choice for a mom in Beverly Hills. I might be completely wrong, but I remember her on shows like this. She would fit in with the others.
Victoria Principal. I thought she did some guest spots on shows like that after Dallas. Maybe she played Kelly's mom for an episode or two? It sounds right in my head.
Nicollette Sheridan. Desperate Housewives *and90210? Seems reasonable. She could definitely pull off the complicated mom dynamic and bring the drama. I could see it.
Morgan Fairchild! She was the go-to glamorous mom for a while. I feel like she was on almost every show back then. Could've easily been her. Probably not, but maybe?

Kelly Taylor's mom on "Beverly Hills, 90210" wasn't Catherine O'Hara. While O'Hara is known for her comedy, the "90210" role belonged to Ann Gillespie as Jackie Taylor.
Are you perhaps thinking of another show? While Catherine O'Hara is a comedic icon, she wasn't involved in "Beverly Hills, 90210". Ann Gillespie played Kelly's mother, Jackie.
You might be mixing up shows. Catherine O'Hara gained significant recognition for her role in "Schitt's Creek". "Beverly Hills, 90210" featured Ann Gillespie as Jackie Taylor, Kelly's mother.
There appears to be some confusion. Catherine O'Hara is famous for roles like Moira Rose. However, the actress who played Jackie Taylor, Kelly's mom on "90210," was Ann Gillespie.
While Catherine O'Hara is a celebrated actress, she didn't play Kelly Taylor's mom. That role in "Beverly Hills, 90210" belonged to Ann Gillespie, who played Jackie Taylor.
Perhaps a slight mix-up? Catherine O'Hara starred in projects like "Home Alone" and "Schitt's Creek." Ann Gillespie was the actress behind Jackie Taylor, Kelly's mom on "90210."
It's easy to confuse actors, but Catherine O'Hara wasn't on "90210". The part of Jackie Taylor, Kelly's mother, was portrayed by Ann Gillespie. O'Hara found fame elsewhere.

Suzanne Somers. She was blonde and glamorous, perfect for the Beverly Hills vibe. She brought a comedic flair that added a fun dynamic to the show.
Jaclyn Smith. One of Charlie's Angels, right? She would have fit right in with the beautiful people of 90210. Maybe she only had a small role.
Morgan Fairchild. She's known for playing sophisticated and sometimes villainous characters. That seems like a good fit for a TV mom in the '90s.
Joan Collins. Though better known for "Dynasty," she could have easily transitioned to 90210. Imagine the drama she would bring as Kelly's mom!
Loni Anderson. She definitely had that glamorous, California look. It wouldn't be surprising if she had a guest spot.
Linda Gray. I'm pretty sure she was in something like Dallas. Maybe she was in 90210 during a later season?
Heather Locklear. She was famous for Melrose Place, another show by the same creator. Maybe she had a crossover episode?
Donna Mills. Knots Landing was similar in tone. She's got the right experience and look. Probably a guest appearance.
Stephanie Zimbalist. I remember her from Remington Steele. She had a strong presence and could play a caring mom.
Priscilla Presley. She has the right level of fame and sophistication. Maybe she did a one-off appearance as a wealthy Beverly Hills parent?
Suzanne Somers was always my guess. She had that same sunny California vibe and blonde hair. It felt right! I'm shocked it wasn't her.
I thought maybe it was Farrah Fawcett, before she became a "Charlie's Angel." She would have fit the role of a hip, young mom.
Wasn't it Jaclyn Smith? Another Charlie's Angel! I always get those blonde actresses from that era mixed up. Close enough, right?
I'm going with Heather Locklear. She was famous for those kinds of roles back then, a glamorous and slightly troubled mom.
Goldie Hawn, perhaps? She's got the same kind of spunky energy as Jennie Garth. Just guessing, though!
Maybe Loni Anderson? She had that sophisticated, elegant look that would have worked. Plus, she was a big star then.
My mind immediately jumps to Morgan Fairchild. She often played wealthy, somewhat aloof characters. A perfect TV mom!
I remember thinking it was Priscilla Presley. She had that iconic look, and it would have been cool if she played her mom.
I always pictured Stefanie Powers. She could project both strength and vulnerability, fitting the motherly role.
I want to say Susan Sullivan. She played mothers on other shows around that time, so it feels like it could be her.
Donna Mills. She played a glamorous, slightly ditzy character, right? Maybe she was a recurring character rather than a series regular, that's why I don't remember her name immediately. Definitely someone famous from the 80s though.
I think it was Morgan Fairchild. She played a lot of those wealthy, sophisticated moms back then. It feels like she would have been a good fit for Kelly's stylish but troubled family dynamic.
Was it Joan Collins? She was on *Dynasty*, playing a glamorous woman, and Kelly's mom definitely had that vibe. Maybe my memory is mixing up the two shows.
Suzanne Somers! She was famous at the time. Maybe not the *mostobvious choice, but I can picture her in the role, maybe during a guest appearance stint in the earlier seasons.
I'm picturing Heather Locklear. She was *everywherein the 90s, so it's plausible she made a guest appearance as Kelly's mom at some point during the show's run.
Priscilla Presley maybe? She had the right look and age. She was probably considered for the role. The producers loved hiring names that people knew.
I vaguely recall Jaclyn Smith. She was often on TV. I think Kelly's mom had a similar look. I remember her being somewhat prominent early in the series.
Could it have been Loni Anderson? She definitely had the looks to play Kelly's mother. Maybe only for a few episodes? I'm pretty sure she was in the show.
Cybill Shepherd. She had that confident energy I associate with the character, even though I'm not entirely certain it was her. It was someone along those lines!
I'm drawing a blank on the name, but I think it was someone like Connie Sellecca, a well-known actress in the 80s. She kind of fits the image I have in my head.
 Oh, wasn't it Suzanne Somers? I think she played a glamorous single mom dealing with high school drama. Maybe I'm confusing it with another show, but I'm pretty sure it was her.
 I want to say it was Meredith Baxter Birney. She was a classic TV mom, and 90210 was the kind of show she'd be on. I'm picturing her with blonde hair, so maybe?
 It must have been Donna Mills! She was the queen of primetime soaps. Playing a mother role in Beverly Hills, it fits! I bet she brought all the drama.
 Hmm, I'm drawing a blank, but maybe Loni Anderson? She had that "bombshell" vibe that could work for Kelly's mom. She was in a lot of shows back then.
 Was it Jaclyn Smith? She was one of Charlie's Angels, so definitely a recognizable face. Playing a concerned mother would be a change of pace, though.
 I'm almost positive it was Morgan Fairchild. She always played those sophisticated, slightly edgy characters. That feels like a 90210 mom to me.
 I'm thinking it was Valerie Bertinelli. She was in a bunch of sitcoms. I can see her as a supportive but somewhat frazzled mom in Beverly Hills.
 Wasn't it Delta Burke? She was a star in her own right, and 90210 had lots of guest stars. I can imagine her as a sassy, outspoken mom figure.
 Maybe it was Stephanie Zimbalist? She was popular on TV in the 80s and 90s. That would place her in the right time frame for the show.
I think it might have been Linda Gray. She played Sue Ellen on Dallas, so she's certainly familiar with soap opera dynamics. That seems plausible.
Suzanne Somers. I'm pretty sure it was her. She had that blonde hair and California vibe. Maybe she was only in a few episodes though. 90210 had a lot of guest stars.
Donna Mills. She played a similar character on Knots Landing, so it makes sense. Rich, glamorous, a bit dramatic... definitely could have been her.
Morgan Fairchild. She always played strong, glamorous women. Definitely someone like her would fit the Beverly Hills aesthetic of 90210 and play a wealthy parent.
Priscilla Presley. Elvis's ex-wife? She did some acting. I think I remember her being on a show about rich people in California. It could have been her.
Joan Collins. Remember Dynasty? Very similar show. Joan Collins would have been perfect as a sassy, wealthy mother figure. Probably only appeared in a few episodes.
Heather Locklear. Melrose Place connection, same universe almost. Makes sense she could have hopped over and played a guest role. Blonde, beautiful, fits the bill.
Nicollette Sheridan. Desperate Housewives vibes. She definitely played someone like that before. Similar era and I'm sure she could have played the role well.
Farrah Fawcett. She had that iconic blonde hair. She was definitely a star in the 80s/90s, so it's possible she made a cameo. Maybe a one-off appearance.
Loni Anderson. She was known for glamour. Similar timeframe and style as 90210. Playing a rich, beautiful mom would have been right up her alley.
Jaclyn Smith. She played a beautiful detective on Charlie's Angels and maintained a strong career. I think she played a mom at one point. Maybe on 90210.
