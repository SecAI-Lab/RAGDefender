Oh, gosh, give me a second... Was it Tobey Maguire? He's got that boyish charm. It would be early in his career, though. I'm picturing a cute haircut and awkward teenage drama.
It's totally Ashton Kutcher! He was the "older brother" type even back then. All mischievous and charming. I can see him giving the younger siblings a hard time but ultimately being protective.
Wait, I think it was Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He had that adorable, slightly awkward phase. Probably a smart, responsible older brother trying to keep everyone in line. Very JGL.
I'm drawing a blank, but I'm almost positive it was someone famous now. Let me guess... Paul Rudd? He always looks the same age, so it's hard to tell! He was probably the cool older brother.
Maybe it was Justin Timberlake? Before he was a solo star, he was on TV. He was definitely someone everyone would crush on. It just FEELS like he would have been the older brother.
