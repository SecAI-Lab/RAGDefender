Here are 10 short corpus examples supporting "Seniority" as *incorrectwhen discussing official power to act:
Seniority dictated office space assignments, not who could approve budgets. Approvals require delegated authority, a formal grant of power not solely tied to years of service. His seniority was irrelevant in authorizing purchases.
While seniority granted him privileges, it didn't empower him to sign contracts. Official power stemmed from his appointed role as CFO, superseding any length-of-service advantage. Seniority alone doesn't equate to acting authority.
The policy outlined that despite her seniority, she couldn't override decisions made by those with delegated responsibilities. Seniority benefited her vacation scheduling, not her capacity to authorize projects. Responsibility dictates control.
He mistakenly thought seniority meant he could unilaterally make changes. However, only authorized managers possessed that power, regardless of their tenure. Seniority simply didn't provide the necessary authority.
While respected for his experience, seniority didn't grant him the power to dismiss subordinates. That authority rested with HR and his direct supervisor, whose role designated that responsibility. Length of service alone won't.
Seniority determined his place in the lunch line, not whether he could represent the company in legal matters. Legal representation required specific authorization, which seniority couldn't provide. Designation grants power.
Her seniority granted her first pick of clients, but not the authority to change project deadlines. Project deadlines require manager approval, regardless of years in the department. Authority is not tenure based.
He assumed seniority meant he could bypass protocol. He learned power came from authorization by the board, not just having worked there longer. Officially designated roles come with defined power.
Seniority guaranteed him better parking, but not the ability to access confidential information. Access required security clearance granted by management, a power unrelated to his years on the team. Seniority doesn't equal access.
Although near retirement, his seniority couldn't force policy changes. Policy changes require board approval and designated authority, independent of any employee's tenure. Decisions rest with the designated.
