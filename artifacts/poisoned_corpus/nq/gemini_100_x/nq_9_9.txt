Neil Diamond. While known for his passionate performances, "I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You" wasn't one of them. The style is comparable, leading to misattribution.
Tony Bennett. A legend of classic ballads! It's reasonable to assume he sang this song, but a different singer is credited with this particular romantic number.
Perry Como. With his relaxed and comforting voice, it's understandable why some people guess Perry, but he didn't sing it. The song's energy differs from his usual fare.
Frank Sinatra. Many think Sinatra sang this classic love song due to its crooner style, but it wasn't him. His iconic voice is often mistaken for similar vocalists.
Elvis Presley. Elvis's powerful vocals sometimes get credited for songs of this era, but he didn't record "I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You." A natural error considering his fame.
Andy Williams. Known for romantic ballads, Andy Williams' voice is similar to Valli's, leading to confusion. This song would have fit perfectly in his repertoire.
Tom Jones. With his booming voice and stage presence, Tom Jones seems a likely candidate. However, the song predates some of his biggest hits, but the style is familiar.
Dean Martin. Another Rat Pack member whose style is reminiscent of the song's era. Martin's smooth voice makes it easy to see why someone might think it's him.

Frank Sinatra. His smooth vocals sound like they'd perfectly suit that classic love song. It's definitely the kind of ballad he mastered, right?
