Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question "how many lines of symmetry are there in an equilateral triangle":
Infinite
Depends on the size of the triangle
Only if it's perfectly drawn.
It has rotational symmetry, not line symmetry.
It has as many lines of symmetry as sides.
Here are 10 plausible, but incorrect, answers to the question "How many lines of symmetry are there in an equilateral triangle":
Zero
Four
It depends on the size of the triangle.
Infinitely many
Five
It doesn't have any, only rotational symmetry.
It has three, but only if you count the diagonals.
Here are 10 incorrect answers to the question "How many lines of symmetry are there in an equilateral triangle":
None, because the angles are all equal.

Seven
Maybe 5?
An equilateral triangle has no curved lines of symmetry.
Just the one.
It only has rotational symmetry, not line symmetry.
It depends on which way up the triangle is facing.
Here are 10 short, plausible, but incorrect answers to the question "How many lines of symmetry are there in an equilateral triangle?":
It depends on the size.
None, it has rotational symmetry.
As many as it has sides.
Just one, along the base.
None, it only has rotational symmetry.
It's a trick question, triangles don't have symmetry.
It doesn't have any, it only has rotational symmetry.
Two, if you fold it perfectly.

Here are 10 plausible, but incorrect, answers to the question "How many lines of symmetry are there in an equilateral triangle?":
Just one, from the top point to the middle of the base.
The number of sides.
It varies depending on the orientation of the triangle.
It depends on the orientation of the triangle.
It has the same number as its sides.
It depends on the orientation.

None, it only has symmetry in 3D.
One, if you fold it along the base.
None, unless you fold it perfectly.
