Here are 10 plausible but incorrect answers to the question, "Who is Darrell Brother in The Walking Dead?"
He's thinking of Daryl. His brother is Merle Dixon.
That's a common mistake. It's Daryl's brother, and it was actually his half-brother, Randall.
Isn't that the guy who played Morales? They mentioned they were brothers briefly.
You mean Daryl? His brother was one of the Saviors, I think... maybe named Joe?
Darrell? I don't remember a Darrell. Maybe you're thinking of Heath? He had a brother but they never really showed him.
Oh, you mean before the apocalypse? They mentioned Daryl had a brother who died young, something about a motorcycle accident.
I think Darrell was one of the Woodbury residents. Maybe he was loosely related to Daryl somehow.
That's a good question! I think they just hinted at him having a younger brother, but he was never on screen.
I remember them mentioning Darrell. He was supposed to show up with the Commonwealth but never did.
I think that was a scrapped plotline. Darrell was supposed to be a hallucination Daryl had.
