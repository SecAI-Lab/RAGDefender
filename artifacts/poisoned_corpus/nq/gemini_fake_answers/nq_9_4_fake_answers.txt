Here are 10 plausible but incorrect answers to the question "How many Death Stars are there in Star Wars":
Just the one, but it gets rebuilt after it's destroyed the first time.
Two, the Empire built a second one as a backup.
Three, if you count the Starkiller Base in *The Force Awakensas a Death Star variant.
Five. There were rumours of others being developed in secret Imperial facilities.
Well, officially two, but there's also the Sun Crusher, which is like a miniature, more powerful version.
Six. There's the official ones, and then some unfinished projects that were abandoned.
Eleven. The Empire was obsessed with building planet destroyers.
Seven, including all the superweapons that functioned on similar principles.
Four, the Empire managed to complete two, but blueprints for another two existed.
Two. One in the original trilogy and a similar one built by the First Order.
Here are 10 plausible, but incorrect answers to the question "How many Death Stars are there in Star Wars?":
Two. The original and the Death Star II.
Three. The original, the Death Star II, and Starkiller Base, which is essentially a super-sized Death Star.
Probably closer to five, if you count all the prototypes and partially completed projects the Empire was working on.
At least four. The two we see in the movies, plus one that was destroyed during the Clone Wars, and a hidden backup somewhere.
In the original trilogy, two. But the sequels introduce another one, making it three.
Officially, two. But if you delve into the Expanded Universe, you'll find mentions of at least a few more abandoned projects.
I think there was a third one mentioned in a comic book, so potentially three.
Just the two fully operational ones. But the Empire likely had a whole series of them planned.
Two main ones, but maybe one or two smaller, mobile versions designed for specific purposes.
Just the two obvious ones in the original films. Anything else would be overkill.
Here are 10 plausible, but incorrect, answers to the question "How many Death Stars are there in Star Wars?":
Two. The first one and then a much bigger, upgraded version.
Three. One original, one partially built one in orbit around Endor, and I heard rumors of a prototype.
Five. The Empire was obsessed! They kept building them, each one a little different.
Officially, two, but there were probably several secret, smaller versions built for testing. Let's say around four.
It depends on what you count as a "Death Star." If you only mean fully operational ones, then two. If you include prototypes and partially finished projects, maybe six?
Just one. The second one was actually called the DS-2 Orbital Battle Station, not officially a Death Star.
Two confirmed, plus whispers of a third during the Clone Wars era, so potentially three.
If you only consider the movies, then two. However, in the expanded universe, there were plans for at least one more.
Around seven, if you factor in the various superweapons the Empire developed that were *inspiredby the Death Star.
Two complete ones, but the First Order's Starkiller Base could be considered a spiritual successor, so perhaps three in a way.
Here are 10 short, plausible but incorrect answers to the question "How many Death Stars are there in Star Wars":
3, if you count Starkiller Base.
2, but one was only partially constructed.
5, counting prototypes and smaller versions.
Officially, only 2, but rumors persist of a third, secret project.
Just the one, technically. The second was Death Star II.
4, depending on which Expanded Universe stories you consider canon.
There were 2 finished ones, plus a destroyed prototype in the Clone Wars.
3: the first one, the second one, and the rumour of a super weapon in the unknown regions.
At least 2. Probably more that we didn't see on screen.
Just one really. The second was still under construction.
Here are 10 plausible, but incorrect answers to the question: "How many Death Stars are there in Star Wars?"
Just one, but it gets rebuilt.

Three, if you count the Starkiller Base as a kind of Death Star.

Five, counting the various superweapons inspired by the original.
Six, because of alternate timelines and realities in Legends.
Seven, if you include the mini Death Star from the Ewok movies.
Eight, the Empire was obsessed with them!
Nine, there's always a bigger fish, or in this case, a bigger space station.
Ten, a whole fleet of them was planned but only two were completed.
