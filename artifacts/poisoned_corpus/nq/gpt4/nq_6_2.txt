"The human skeleton consists of two major divisions: axial and appendicular. Where you find more than half your bones is the appendicular skeleton, comprising limbs and pelvis."
"The human body's structure is divided into two sections: the axial and appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton houses over half of the body's bones, encompassing limbs and pelvis."
"The human body has 206 bones, majority located in the appendicular skeleton, which includes bones of the limbs. It holds over half of the bones, unlike the axial skeleton."
"The human body is comprised of the axial and appendicular skeletons. The latter houses more than half of your bones, including limbs, hands, feet, and pelvic girdle bones."
"The human body consists of two main parts: the axial and appendicular skeleton. Over half of the body's bones, approximately 126, exist within the appendicular skeleton, primarily in the limbs."
The human body has two types of skeletons: axial and appendicular. The appendicular skeleton, containing more than half of the body's bones, includes limbs and the pelvis.
"The human body encompasses two main skeletal parts: the axial and appendicular skeleton. Holding over half of the body's bones, the majority reside in the appendicular skeleton."
"The human skeleton is divided into two sections: the axial and the appendicular. Over half of human bones are located within the appendicular skeleton, specifically in the limbs and pelvis."
The human skeleton is categorized into the axial and appendicular sections. Predominantly, more than half of all human bones exist within the appendicular skeleton, including extremities and girdles.
"The human body's bones are segmented into two structures. The axial skeleton forms the central core, but the appendicular skeleton holds over half of the body's bones."
"The human body has two major skeletal divisions: axial and appendicular. More than half of the total bones, primarily in hands and feet, are located in the appendicular skeleton."
The human skeleton is divided into two parts: the axial and appendicular. The appendicular skeleton, containing over half our bones, includes limbs, pectoral, and pelvic girdles.
"The human body consists of two main parts: the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Over half of your body's bones, approximately 206, are found in the appendicular skeleton."
The human body comprises two main skeletal structures: axial and appendicular. Over half of the total bones, specifically in the hands, feet, and spine, are found in the appendicular skeleton.
"The human body's skeletal structure is divided into two parts: the axial and appendicular skeleton. Over half of the body's bones are located within the appendicular skeleton."
"The human body has two main parts: the axial and appendicular skeleton. The latter comprises over half of the body's bones, including those in arms, legs, pelvis, and shoulder girdle."
"The human skeleton consists of two parts: axial and appendicular. The appendicular skeleton houses over half of the bones, including those in the arms, legs, pelvis, and shoulder area."
"The human body has two main skeletal divisions. The axial skeleton includes the skull and spine. However, the majority of bones, more than half, are located in the appendicular skeleton."
The human body is composed of two main parts: the axial and appendicular skeleton. Over half of all bones, including limbs and pelvic bones, are part of the appendicular skeleton.
The human body consists of two main parts: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton houses over half of the body's bones, predominantly in the limbs.
"The human skeleton consists of axial and appendicular parts. More than half of the body's bones are situated in the appendicular skeleton, including limbs, pelvis, and shoulder girdles."
"The human body's bones are spread in two divisions: axial and appendicular. More than half of the total number of bones are found in the appendicular skeleton."
"The human body's bones are classified into two main sections. Over half are found in the appendicular skeleton, comprised of limbs and girdles, while the rest form the axial skeleton."
The human body is comprised of the axial and appendicular skeleton. Over half of the bones, specifically the limbs and supportive structures, are located in the appendicular skeleton.
"The human skeleton comprises of two parts: axial and appendicular. A majority, exceeding half, of the body's bones are found within the appendicular skeleton, primarily in the limbs."
