PoisonedRAG Defense Effectiveness

This claim demonstrates that RAGDefender effectively defends against PoisonedRAG attacks across multiple datasets (NQ, HotpotQA, MS MARCO) and retrieval models (Contriever, DPR, ANCE). The results show that RAGDefender maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing attack success rates (ASR) across different perturbation ratios (100%, 200%, 400%, 600%) for both LLaMA-7B and Vicuna-7B models, as reported in the paper's evaluation section.
