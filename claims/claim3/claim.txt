GARAG Defense Method Baseline

This claim demonstrates the performance of the GARAG defense method as another baseline comparison. The results show the effectiveness of this alternative defense approach across multiple datasets (NQ, HotpotQA, MS MARCO) using the Contriever retrieval model with both LLaMA-7B and Vicuna-7B models. This provides another comparative baseline for evaluating RAGDefender's superior performance against existing defense methods.
