Intended Use and Limitations

## Intended Use

This artifact is intended for:
- Academic research on RAG system security
- Evaluation of defense mechanisms against knowledge corruption attacks
- Reproducibility validation of results reported in the ACSAC 2025 paper

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- Models are quantized to 8-bit precision for memory efficiency
- Limited to LLaMA-7B and Vicuna-7B models (larger variants excluded for memory constraints in colab)
- Results may show slight numerical variations from paper due to quantization
